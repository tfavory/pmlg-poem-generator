be peace on earth, good will to men
and let this now our carol be
if on the land, or on the sea
we still will sing the glad refrain
and in the closing light of day
good words of peace and cheer will say

the babe that in the manger born
has risen high above the star
to judge in peace, or judge in war
to judge at night or judge at morn
the star that told us of his birth
has given us joy and lasting mirth

the man that suffered on the tree
is risen high above all men
then swell the glad refrain again
he died for me, he died for thee
then peace be ever on the earth
to one and all of human birth


the apple tree has fallen, now
the axe has laid it low
the blossoms sparkled ere it fell
but now they wither so

its shade we now shall seek in vain
the spot we loved so well
has vanished since the apple tree
so loudly crashing fell

no more the wind sings through the leaves
the song so dear to me
ah! yes, that rustling far above
was one of melody

no more we see that staunch old tree
the axe has laid it low
and much we’ll miss it, evermore
that fall was one of woe


the angel of peace flew over the land
and the country was wild with glee
and she stilled the wave in the stormy night
on a rolling and restless sea

but the angel of death flew over the land
and a babe was taken that night
and an angel sweet in heaven appeared
in the land of glory and light


in a palace sad and lonely
flit two spectres all the day
spectres chasing joy and brightness
from each window far away

one is sorrow clad in raiment
sombre as the shades of night
while her trailing robes of darkness
chase away each ray of light

but the other one is envy
clad in blackness, clad with woe
sorrow’s only sad companion
flitting ever to and fro

by the windows ever gliding
filling all with thoughts of pain
all who gaze are doomed forever
ne’er to see bright joy again


all around us, ever floating
silently yet swiftly on
pass the years in quick succession
years that are forever gone

years that soon are past recalling
years of gladness or of woe
we can never stop their fleeting
but forever they will go

years of sorrow passing round us
dark and dreary as the night
years of gladness quickly follow
bringing thoughts all fair and bright

still the years continue passing
swiftly as the years can be
till we leave our pains and sorrow
till we find eternity


i would i had some magic pen
that would my thoughts convey
there were a mighty pen that would
the world astound to-day

they come and go as fountains flow
unceasing, always flowing
for while some thoughts are coming fast
the others fast are going


on the bright red coals before me
pictures come and pictures go
pictures of the waiting future
filled with gladness or with woe

by the fireside do i picture
to myself my destiny
who knows but these golden raptures
may be real unto me

though the storm outside be raving
and the snowflakes drift on high
by the fireside i am safely
counting on what may be nigh

all the flames fly ever upward
coiling into every form
fairies circle ever round me
heedless of the outside storm

still i watch the weird wild raptures
of the golden dream so nigh
let us love our happy fancies
e’er the time has passed us by


see the grass upon its threshold
see the ivy on its wall
vacant are its crumbling windows
vacant is its mossy hall

ah! the step of man upon it
shall resound along no more
for the spirits of the dead ones
ever flit about the door

there the whisperings of the voices
of the spirits of the dead
those of friends and enemies
ever murmur ’round your head

let us leave the haunted ruin
spirits walk the crumbling floor
light their step, but oh! their voices
haunt the building evermore


peaceful be for we have reached it
lighter, lighter ever tread
’tis a sacred spot and hallowed
’tis the kingdom of the dead

silent kingdom, sad and lonely
though so many in it dwell
who can number all its people
who, ah! who can ever tell

still and peaceful is their resting
in their last and humble bed
tread ye lightly, ’tis the kingdom
of the sacred holy dead


hear ye not the howling wind
sad and wild
in its wake come dismal fancies
never mild

like the moaning of the lost
comes the wind
moaning, sighing--viewless phantoms
come behind

in the darkness come the spirits
of the night
howling, with their dismal groaning
in their flight

absent friends come in our fancies
evermore
as the demons flee from hades
rush and roar

hear ye not the moaning wind
moan and quiver
like the moaning of the lost
lost forever



over hill and over valley
over meadows rich and green
playing with the summer grasses
fairer sights were never seen

not a mortal ever saw me
though i see them ev’ry day
passing like a viewless spirit
on my happy singing way

often do i rise up skyward
chasing fast the cloudlets there
and i drive them headlong onward
till they all in fragments tear

often on the field of battle
’mid the storm that works them woe
do i cheer ’mid cannon’s rattle
kissing both the friend and foe

and the wounded, as he listens
to me as i whistle on
thinks of home and friends and parents
and of days that now have gone

i often whistle through the woods
and toss the hunter’s hair
he sits him down upon a log
while i caress him there

his brow with sweat is covered o’er
he feels my cooling sway
i toss about his silver locks
that deck his head of gray

but on i go until i find
the farmer in his field
i whistle o’er his garnered store
the willing land doth yield

he hails me as his merry friend
and thus i am to him
i never pass without i cheer
his features calm and grim

i cheer the poet as he sings
beside some flowing stream
and looks upon the dim, dim past
a vision or a dream


he hails me, as i sail along
in accents clear and free
i answer in an unknown tongue
and pass on cheerily

he knows me well, and loves me too
he watches till i find
his resting place where he may leave
all earthly cares behind

i visit oft where lovers sit
i hear their vows of love
the bright green grass is all below
the sky of blue above

and there they sit and talk of love
as only lovers know
they think the world a paradise
and all things bright below


i visit oft the city’s haunts
i raise the dust on high
and whirl it like a water-wheel
as ever on i fly

i play with wigs and hats and cloaks
and whistle by the house
then to a gentle zephyr turn
as quiet as a mouse

then breaking in an angry fit
i whistle by the bell
that hangs within the steeple tall
and sound a faint, low knell

by ruins old i make my way
i tear the ivy vines
and fill with dust and sand and dirt
the ancient sculptured lines


i ramble on the deep, dark sea
and toss those waves of blue
i scare the boasting mariner
and tear the sails in two

the clouds that hang far overhead
are dropping to the sea
the waves as mountains now become
i roar out in my glee

the captain stands with face aghast
with terror in his eyes
the fork-ed lightning strikes its wings
that waft it from the skies

the thunder stops, the clouds pass by
the waves are resting now
the gallant ship before my breath
with magic speed doth plow


ye frightened goodly mariners
that angels were before
the storm has quit, you curse again
you’re sinners wild once more

and when the next storm rocks the ship
and the thunders roll and roar
you drop upon your knees again
art sainted then once more

i cross the sea, and soon i find
europa’s golden coast
the spanish pride;--the english tar
makes well his frequent boast


i love the clime of africa
the dark man’s native home
i love that central, torrid zone
wherever i may roam

i also love the northern pole
auroras glisten there
i love the regions still and cold
the icebergs standing bare

the water trickling down their sides
i waft them towards the south
the walrus suns him as we go
and opes his giant mouth

i love to sway the trees in spring
when all in green they stand
in winter do i move their boughs
while roaming o’er the land

sometimes i frolic round about
between the earth and sky
and it is true where’er i go

i love to whirl the storm around
and roar out ev’rywhere
and superstitious people, too
i often sadly scare

i’ve seen fair eden’s leafy trees
i’ve seen the first of man
and i shall see the last of him
i saw how he began


i saw the star of bethlehem
i heard the angels sing
i saw the manger and the christ
the great and goodly king

i saw the cæsar in his rome
who raised her towers on high
she raised those towers aloof from earth
she rose, and but to die

then passing in the flight of years
i saw napoleon’s day
i saw the time when he did rise
and when he fell away

i saw the hero, washington
who for his country fought
“i’ll free my country from her bonds,”
that was his only thought

i’ve known more things than history
and if i brought to light
these things ’twould make the stoutest heart
to start aback with fright

i’ve witnessed murders never seen
by any human eye
i’ve seen the very best of men
by violence to die

i’ve touched the knife that did the deed
i’ve kissed the brow in vain
no sign of life upon the face
so dark and black with pain


i know of secrets never known
to any one but me
i’ve seen when death had come at last
and set the captive free

then listen as i pass along
for aye and evermore
i sing my only song to you
as i pass by your door


often have i sung this story
when at midnight’s solemn reign
like a ghost or howling demon
will i sing it oft again

i have lived through all the ages
and will live for many more
blowing by the stormy ocean
on the sea and on the shore

on the shore or on the ocean
ne’er deserting, always constant
as my zephyrs gently fly

you will find me in the future
just as i have always been
free from all unjust transgressions
free from any kind of sin

often do i waft the odors
from the fields of clover sweet
when with breath of sweetest perfume
do i all the woodlands greet


so good-bye; i must be speeding
stirring up the autumn leaves
i must visit now the farmer
as he binds his golden sheaves

i must visit now the smithy
and his anvil ringing clear
even now his clanking irons
do i faintly seem to hear

now, adieu; i must be speeding
where the wild wings swiftly fly
and the clouds go by me floating
so i bid you all “good-bye.”


oh, bright the day when england’s crown
came forth to crown the king
and in the minds of those around
it seemed no trifling thing

“give back the crown!” was william’s word
“or my good sword shall pay
with heavy thrust and bleeding cut
for this you’ve done to-day.”

for edward’s will that crown had sent
to grace stern william’s head
but harold too had claimed the right
and for that right he bled

aye! bled, and died, and lost the crown
he’d struggled so to save
and ah! that struggle led him to
his solitary grave

yes! godwin’s son was born to fight
to chase and not to fly
and he was born for hasting’s fate
and that fate was to die

ah! weep ye noble saxon men
the last king of your line
shall sleep the cold, still sleep of death
that solemn sleep divine

to-day we merry are and joy
doth reign supreme around
and music seems in every noise
and ev’ry passing sound

to-morrow comes--that joy is gone
there lies the human clay
the spirit to its rest has gone
where brighter shines the day

we know not when that bidding comes
that bears us from the earth
how few the years that stand between
our death-call and our birth

thus was’t with harold--in the night
carousing in the tent
his joy was great, but ’morrows light
his knee in suppliance bent

the cup went round,--and small thought they
upon the next day’s fight
that harold soon in death should lie
within the waning light

in william’s camp no cup went round
but heads were bent in prayer
and plans were laid; then silence kept
its peaceful reigning there

oh! solemn was the prayer they said
and solemn was the scene
the archers with their bows stood by
with grave and silent mien

the morning came,--the proud array
stood silent as the dead
the battle-axes in their hands
did rise far overhead

and in the midst, his armor bright
stood harold with his sword
and far and near around stood those
who waited at his word

the banner rose above them all
its warrior stood on high
and precious stones did mark him there
that scarcely wealth could buy

duke william led his heroes forth
and gave them to the fray
ah, many of those heroes there
ne’er saw another day

the battle raged, and sunset came
and flashed on armor bright
and all around were mangled men
it was an awful sight

king harold fell, the arrow pierced
and bore him to the ground
ah! then was heard a trampling noise
a wildly flying sound

the warrior and the banner fell
and dyed were they in blood
no more the saxon’s sang their shout
“god’s rood! aye, holy rood!”


drifting down the tide we go
nay! we hoist the sail
speeding fast and faster still
with the blowing gale

come sign the pledge and get on board
and leave behind your woe
for the sky is bright, and the gale is right
as like the wind we go

we sail between the shores of green
on the waters shining breast
oh! sign the pledge and the ribbon don
and forever you’ll find rest

sweet rest upon our temperance ship
and leave behind your woe
for the sky is bright and the gale is right
as like the wind we go


there is a hall of memory
within a happy land
the walls are high and marble clear
with wealth on every hand

the railings on the stairway
are made of purest gold
the marble steps below them
are hard and stern and cold

i love the hall of memory
i love to linger there
sweet visions coming evermore
its pictures bright and fair

its walls are decked with pictures
made by a masters hand
the marble figures far and near
alive they seem to stand

but there is one fair picture
i love to gaze upon
it is the picture of a time
that is forever gone

there is a hall of memory
its walls are stern and high
the treasures it contains for me
no wealth can ever buy


the cold moon-light is shining clear
the tall trees shadows throw
and all is spectral far and near
as far as eye can go

a peaceful calm rests o’er the scene
the clouds no longer fly
the busy world is hushed and still
its cares have passed us by

but when to-morrow’s light has come
then comes the care and pain
the strife and warfare of our lives
is rushing on again

but still the white clouds fleck the sky
and peace is reigning on
but soon the beauty of the night
will fade and fast be gone


far in the west is the sunset land
where flows a mighty river
it flows right o’er the crimson clouds
and it follows the sun forever

the stars come chasing through the sky
they chase and they twinkle and play
and they love the clouds of the sunset land
that soon will be far away

and the twilight jealous and sombre and sad
comes down with his robes of gray
and he chases the light of the sunset land
far from the west away


when the weary day at last
with its cares and strife is past

when i lay me down to sleep
while the angels vigils keep

comes an echo far away
of the doings of the day

ere my weary eyelids close
ere my being seeks repose

comes a voice from far away
“what hast thou performed this day?”

yes the air is full of spirits
many does each man inherit

but at night each one will say
“what hast thou performed this day?”

ere my weary eyelids close
ere i calmly seek repose

comes an echo far away
“what hast thou performed this day?”


the seagull screamed and flopped his wings
and hied him to his home
the breakers dashed upon the shore
their crests were filled with foam

the briny mounts were thrown on high
where reeled a ship; the gale
had shorn her of her masts, and torn
in shreds each flying sail

alas! a wail comes o’er the deep
the ship is sinking fast
the mighty mountains of the sea
are aided by the blast

’tis morn again, the rosy morn
the storm at sea is o’er
the elements are calm and still
the wreck is on the shore

then take good care in future life
while near the billows roll
take care lest your own self be lost
by shipwreck of your soul

then never let the breakers roll
to whelm the bark within
as in the world you sail around
the blackened sea of sin


it was in africa’s torrid clime
two sisters stood alone
and what they witnessed was a sight
to melt a heart of stone

the english came and carried off
one sister, far away
and now in london’s haunts she stands
and sorrows all the day

they took her from her native spot
where she was wont to stand
and placed her in a foreign clime
within a foreign land

ah! how she feels, with other eyes
than on bright egypt’s shore
she stands where she had never been
to stand for evermore

the others came with iron bonds
her sister, too, they brought
to grace america’s bright parks
where pity ne’er was thought

ah! yes, in new york city’s haunts
that sister is to be
between the two the waters lie
a dark and stormy sea

ah! now when i to egypt’s plains
do wend my careful way
i’ll seek the spot where once they stood
and there respect i’ll pay

but, oh, the beauties will be gone
the sisters are not there
insulted by a grosser race
they stand where naught is fair






the snow is lying deep upon the ground
and naught disturbs the quiet, bitter air
except the distant jingling sleigh bells sound
which seems to banish from my heart all care
the trees are barren of their waving leaves
the limbs are swaying sadly to and fro
it seems as though it for its verdure grieves
as down it shakes the flakes of shining snow
oh, thou to me forever art a friend
i would that you were for the whole year round
and he on high those blessings by you send
that always in your bounteous lap are found
and you and i would be as angels here
and sorrow never know nor ever shed a tear


thou dancing sunbeams through the happy day
dost cheer me on my onward path through life
you show to me more clear my stumbling way
and lighter make my almost ceaseless strife
thou art to me a greater friend indeed
than others i have loved up to this hour
they are oft but a wildly growing weed
but thou art like a shining summer flow’r
the world could not exist if not for thee
the ice-king would possession then obtain
the light and beauty from all things would flee
and naught but lasting, dark’ning chaos reighn
but now we have the cheerful, glittering light
that keeps the universe alive and bright




let us now improve the present
waiting not for something more
for the past is gone forever
and its troubles all are o’er

let us hope not in the future
golden days will be at hand
try, keep trying, for that country
in a fairer, better land

up, be doing in the present
waiting not for something more
for the past is gone forever
and its troubles all are o’er

those who wait are ne’er receiving
those who act are always blest
up, be doing, still be acting
this is not a time for rest

let us now improve the present
waiting not for something more
for the past is gone forever
and its troubles all are o’er


little ada now has gone
to that land above
where no trouble ever comes
all is brightness, all is love

now an angel far away
in that land of light
cheer up, oh, afflicted ones
she is gone where all is bright

father, cheer the grieving parents
help them now to bear the woe
pity us, thy simple children
in this land so far below

angels carried her to heaven
clothed her in their robes of light
she is gone, but not forever
from the loving parents’ sight

little ada now has gone
to that land above
where no trouble ever comes
all is brightness, all is love


on the summit of a mountain
stood i in the twilight gray
there were many standing with me
in the closing light of day

two paths led out from the summit
one to lands so clear and bright
and the other to a dark land
where reigned eternal night

many chose the road to darkness
pathway leading down to hell
few there were that took the other
they that chose it, chose it well

’twas a dream i dreamed in slumber
but ’tis real every day
many take the downward path
few that go the brighter way


an old man entered a dram-shop
he staggerd and stumbled in
his face was as hard as granite
his hair was light and thin

the bar-keeper’s daughter entered
in a dress of purest white
and she looked as sweet as could be
in her nice new clothes that night

the old man stopped, and reasoned
for his own dear child he knew
was shoeless and cold and ragged
and his wife was starving, too

so the dime that lay in his pocket
bought bread for his wife that night
and the old bar-keeper’s daughter
still dressed in her snowy white

but soon ere the winter was over
the drunkard was drunkard no more
and the wife and child were happy
as they never had been before


oh, fresh from the woodland comes the breath
the breath of the beautiful spring
and the gentle zephyrs that float about
scents from the meadow and forest bring
and in every tree
a robin in glee
is chanting a joyous melody

oh the sweet calm breath of beautiful spring
and the azure sky is bright above
and the warm sunshine makes the whole world glad
for every beam is a message of love
and in every tree
the robin in glee
is chanting a joyous melody

the warm sun shines and the sweet flowers bloom
but ah, the wild winds will be raving amain
and the cold gray winter will ravish our joys
the beauties of earth will be vanished again
from every tree
the robin will flee
and fly to the south with his melody

but let us enjoy these transient delights
and gaze on their beauty while linger they here
let us thank our dear father such grandeur may come
while spring claims her place in every year
and in every tree
a robin will be
chanting a beautiful melody


through the din of patt’ring rain drops
comes the thunder in the night
while the bold electric flashes
dazzle for a while the sight

patter, patter come the rain-drops
streaming down the window-pane
on the roof, unceasing, patter
noisy little drops of rain

all the stars have left and hidden
and the cresent is no more
when will come the day and sunshine
as it came in days of yore

but the patter of the rain-drops
music to my thoughts they make
when the rumbling peals of thunder
rhyme and even rhythm break

may we thankful be for sunshine
may we thankful be for rain
come again, oh patt’ring rain-drops
with your music come again








on solferino’s dizzy heights there grew
the bright green grass and here and there were seen
the golden hues of flow’rets shining fair
the bright, warm sunshine sparkled on the world
and all the cloudlets of the azure sky
dark shadows threw upon the happy scene


but on the crest of that tall cliff there frowned
the battered walls the battlements and tow’rs
and in the castle solferino’s prince
walked to and fro and ’round him stood his men
and ere the heart had time to falter once
was heard the deafening rolling cannon’s roar


“the foe has come!” they flew to arms, and ere
the echoes quite had died away, they gave
forth shot for shot and shout for shout
then was thy life-blood spilt! that day
was one of woe to thee sardinia
those lives have left forevermore this earth


then came the awful ravage of the fray
the cannon’s roar, the dying’s groan, the sounds of war
and ev’rywhere was blood--the verdure was
beneath the hard foot trampled and the day
turned dark beneath the reign of chaos wild


the mincio’s waters drifted toward the sea
but ever on its bosom wild was borne
the life-blood of the soldier’s in the fray
ah! red as blood its once clear waters were
and on its banks the same dread curse prevailed


thus man shall slay and man shall die until
the time when his wild fury thus unchecked
shall spend itself and once relapse away
oh! may man’s conscience soon awake to learn
the wild disaster that his fury wrought



the cold gray mist crept o’er the shore
and hung about the bay
we saw the foaming of the surf
within the twilight gray

but through the twilight cold and still
we heard the hum from yonder town
we saw the path around the hill
come winding ever slowly down

the wild wind rose as night came on
we heard the waves beat on the shore
the tempest wailed and moaned about
above the distant roar

sad night, alas! was that to some
who, on the dreary ocean wide
heard far and near the tempest come
the wailing winds on either side

a dreadful night--a stormy night
it swept the wrecks ashore
it was a time--a dreadful sight
forgotten nevermore

that night was one of woe, alas
the wild wind whistled by
and seemed to be as it did pass
some struggling sailor’s drowning cry


far in the west is a peaceful land
where the golden sunset fades away
and fast as the twilight shadows come
the sunset bids farewell to day

the snow white vapor in fragments flies
and the gold-edged clouds near the sunset move
but the twilight, dim and dark and gray
steals fast from sight this land of love

the zephyrs stir and the soft leaves wave
and sigh for the loss of the sunset sky
but even the beauties that shine in the west
must ever fade till the glories die


in the distance dim a valley lies
where flows a deep dark river
on the farther shore a city stands
where the tide flows on forever

a cloud hangs o’er the city fair
by day in the valley yonder
by night in the streets, devoid of light
wild phantoms ever wander

no sound comes forth from the vacant domes
that gleam in the quiet air
no living thing breaks the solitude
but the phantoms wander there

in the distance dim a valley lies
where flows a rolling river
but the phantoms wander by its side
as time flies by forever


when the sunset in the west
gilds the landscape far and near
wraps the sun within his shroud
dies he on a glorious bier

when the night falls o’er the land
comes the cresent from the sky
silence reigns upon the scene
as the brooklet hurries by

when the starlight cold and still
falls upon the earth below
falls upon the church-yard hill
by the saddened brooklets flow

slower come the drifting waters
ceasing once their noisy glee
as it passes by it sings on
in a plaintive melody

ghostly rise the marble spectres
o’er the beds of those who sleep
ever in the night or day time
still their solemn vigils keep

when the sunrise in the east
gilds the sky with flames of light
runs the brooklet fast to meet
with its waters ever bright

onward to the flowing river
and its waters mingle there
oh! when shall they return agan
to the brooklet shining fair


when the christ was born on earth
then wise men the star did guide
till with riches they appeared
by the great messiah’s side

and the angels ever echoed
songs of happiness again
and a voice from heaven answered

still the star whirled in its orbit
round the sun of heat and light
saw the earth in years advancing
watched her in her rapid flight

when we slumber peacefully
when we think not what is near
still the star’s light shineth ever
all its beams are bright and clear

thus forever, yet unceasing
still it shineth as of yore
and shall be a guide and helper
through the ages evermore


this volume out of respect to a little girl of six years who used to
love to recite it to me. she knew many poems, but this was her
favourite

i shot an arrow into the air
it fell to earth, i knew not where
for, so swiftly it flew, the sight
could not follow it in its flight

i breathed a song into the air
it fell to earth, i knew not where
for who has sight so keen and strong
that it can follow the flight of song

long, long afterward, in an oak
i found the arrow, still unbroke
and the song, from beginning to end
i found again in the heart of a friend



i found "the babie" in stedman's "anthology." it is placed in this
volume by permission of the poet, jeremiah eames rankin, of cleveland
fancy was greatly moved by the two beautiful lines

i'm glad she has no wings

nae shoon to hide her tiny taes
nae stockin' on her feet
her supple ankles white as snaw
or early blossoms sweet

her simple dress o' sprinkled pink
her double, dimplit chin
her puckered lips, and baumy mou
with na ane tooth within

her een sae like her mither's een
twa gentle, liquid things
her face is like an angel's face
we're glad she has nae wings



that the world cannot outgrow. once in the mind, they fasten. they were
not born to die

let dogs delight to bark and bite
for god hath made them so
let bears and lions growl and fight
for 'tis their nature too

but, children, you should never let
such angry passions rise
your little hands were never made
to tear each other's eyes



little drops of water
little grains of sand
make the mighty ocean
and the pleasant land

thus the little minutes
humble though they be
make the mighty ages
of eternity



these two stanzas, the very heart of that great poem, "the ancient
mariner," by samuel taylor coleridge (1772-1834), sum up the lesson of
this masterpiece--"insensibility is a crime

farewell, farewell! but this i tell
to thee, thou wedding-guest
he prayeth well who loveth well
both man and bird and beast

he prayeth best who loveth best
all things, both great and small
for the dear god who loveth us
he made and loveth all



twinkle, twinkle, little star
how i wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky

when the glorious sun is set
when the grass with dew is wet
then you show your little light
twinkle, twinkle all the night

in the dark-blue sky you keep
and often through my curtains peep
for you never shut your eye
till the sun is in the sky

as your bright and tiny spark
guides the traveller in the dark
though i know not what you are
twinkle, twinkle, little star


right with the world" is a cheerful motto for the nursery and
schoolroom

the year's at the spring
the day's at the morn
morning's at seven
the hillside's dew pearled

the lark's on the wing
the snail's on the thorn

there was never a queen like balkis
from here to the wide world's end
but balkis talked to a butterfly
as you would talk to a friend

there was never a king like solomon
not since the world began
but solomon talked to a butterfly
as a man would talk to a man

and _he_ was asia's lord
but they both of 'em talked to butterflies
when they took their walks abroad




pussy can sit by the fire and sing
pussy can climb a tree
or play with a silly old cork and string
to 'muse herself, not me
but i like binkie, my dog, because
he knows how to behave
so, binkie's the same as the first friend was
and i am the man in the cave

pussy will play man-friday till
it's time to wet her paw
and make her walk on the window-sill
then she fluffles her tail and mews
and scratches and won't attend
but binkie will play whatever i choose
and he is my true first friend

pussy will rub my knees with her head
pretending she loves me hard
but the very minute i go to my bed
pussy runs out in the yard

and there she stays till the morning light
so i know it is only pretend
but binkie, he snores at my feet all night
and he is my firstest friend




popular short poems extant. i have taught it to a great many very young
boys, and not one has ever tried to evade learning it. older pupils
like it equally well

i have a little shadow that goes in and out with me
and what can be the use of him is more than i can see
he is very, very like me from the heels up to the head
and i see him jump before me, when i jump into my bed

the funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow
not at all like proper children, which is always very slow
for he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball
and he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all

he hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play
and can only make a fool of me in every sort of way
he stays so close beside me, he's a coward, you can see
i'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me

one morning, very early, before the sun was up
i rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup
but my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head
had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed



this poem (george macdonald, 1828-) finds a place in this volume
because, as a child, i loved it. it completely filled my heart, and has
made every member of the lily family dear to me. george macdonald's
charming book, "at the back of the north wind," also was my wonder and
delight

little white lily
sat by a stone
drooping and waiting
till the sun shone
little white lily
sunshine has fed
little white lily
is lifting her head

little white lily
said: "it is good
little white lily's
clothing and food
little white lily
dressed like a bride
shining with whiteness
and crownèd beside

little white lily
drooping with pain
waiting and waiting
for the wet rain
little white lily
holdeth her cup
rain is fast falling
and filling it up

little white lily
said: "good again
when i am thirsty
to have the nice rain
now i am stronger
now i am cool
heat cannot burn me
my veins are so full

little white lily
smells very sweet
on her head sunshine
rain at her feet
thanks to the sunshine
thanks to the rain
little white lily
is happy again



children because it helps to reconcile them to going to bed. "i go to
bed by day" is one of the crosses of childhood

the great tree to his children said
yes, very sleepy, little red
it is quite time to go to bed

dear father tree, behold our grief
we do not want to go away

so, for just one more merry day
to the great tree the leaflets clung
frolicked and danced, and had their way
upon the autumn breezes swung
whispering all their sports among

and let us stay until the spring
if we all beg, and coax, and fret
but the great tree did no such thing
he smiled to hear their whispering

and ere the leaves could urge their prayer
he shook his head, and far and wide
fluttering and rustling everywhere
down sped the leaflets through the air

i saw them; on the ground they lay
golden and red, a huddled swarm
waiting till one from far away
white bedclothes heaped upon her arm
should come to wrap them safe and warm

the great bare tree looked down and smiled
and from below each sleepy child
replied, "good-night," and murmured



volume out of respect to an eight-year-old child who chose it from
among hundreds. we had one poetry hour every week, and he studied and
recited it with unabated interest to the end of the year

wee willie winkie rins through the town
up-stairs and doon-stairs, in his nicht-gown
tirlin' at the window, cryin' at the lock

hey, willie winkie! are ye comin' ben
the cat's singin' gay thrums to the sleepin' hen
the doug's speldered on the floor, and disna gie a cheep
but here's a waukrife laddie that winna fa' asleep

onything but sleep, ye rogue! glow'rin' like the moon
rattlin' in an airn jug wi' an airn spoon
rumblin' tumblin' roun' about, crowin' like a cock
skirlin' like a kenna-what--wauknin' sleepin' folk

hey, willie winkie! the wean's in a creel
waumblin' aff a body's knee like a vera eel
ruggin' at the cat's lug, and ravellin' a' her thrums
hey, willie winkie!--see, there he comes

wearie is the mither that has a storie wean
a wee stumpie stoussie that canna rin his lane
that has a battle aye wi' sleep before he'll close an ee
but a kiss frae aff his rosy lips gies strength anew to me



because i once found that a timid child was much strengthened and
developed by learning it. it is a song that appeals to the imagination
of children, and they like to sing it

the owl and the pussy-cat went to sea
in a beautiful pea-green boat
they took some honey, and plenty of money
wrapped up in a five-pound note
the owl looked up to the moon above
and sang to a small guitar
what a beautiful pussy you are
you are
what a beautiful pussy you are

pussy said to the owl, "you elegant fowl
how wonderful sweet you sing
oh, let us be married,--too long we have tarried
but what shall we do for a ring
they sailed away for a year and a day
to the land where the bong-tree grows
and there in a wood a piggy-wig stood
with a ring in the end of his nose
his nose
with a ring in the end of his nose

your ring?" said the piggy, "i will
so they took it away, and were married next day
by the turkey who lives on the hill
they dined upon mince and slices of quince
which they ate with a runcible spoon
and hand in hand on the edge of the sand
they danced by the light of the moon
the moon
they danced by the light of the moon



children, who are all by nature sailors and adventurers

wynken, blynken, and nod one night
sailed off in a wooden shoe
sailed on a river of crystal light
into a sea of dew
the old moon asked the three
that live in this beautiful sea
nets of silver and gold have we
said wynken
blynken
and nod

the old moon laughed and sang a song
as they rocked in the wooden shoe
and the wind that sped them all night long
ruffled the waves of dew
the little stars were the herring-fish
that lived in the beautiful sea
never afeard are we
so cried the stars to the fishermen three
wynken
blynken
and nod

all night long their nets they threw
to the stars in the twinkling foam
then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
bringing the fishermen home
as if it could not be
and some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
of sailing that beautiful sea
but i shall name you the fishermen three
wynken
blynken
and nod

wynken and blynken are two little eyes
and nod is a little head
and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
is a wee one's trundle-bed
so shut your eyes while mother sings
of wonderful sights that be
and you shall see the beautiful things
as you rock on the misty sea
where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three
wynken
blynken
and nod



humorous poem that has come under my notice. in making such a
collection as this it is not easy to find poems at once delicate
witty, and graphic. i have taught "the duel" hundreds of times, and
children invariably love it

the gingham dog and the calico cat
side by side on the table sat
nor one nor t'other had slept a wink
the old dutch clock and the chinese plate
appeared to know as sure as fate
there was going to be a terrible spat
what was told to me by the chinese plate

the gingham dog went "bow-wow-wow
and the calico cat replied "mee-ow
the air was littered, an hour or so
with bits of gingham and calico
while the old dutch clock in the chimney-place
up with its hands before its face
for it always dreaded a family row
what the old dutch clock declares is true

the chinese plate looked very blue
and wailed, "oh, dear! what shall we do
but the gingham dog and the calico cat
wallowed this way and tumbled that
employing every tooth and claw
in the awfullest way you ever saw
and, oh! how the gingham and calico flew
i got my views from the chinese plate

next morning where the two had sat
they found no trace of the dog or cat
and some folks think unto this day
that burglars stole the pair away
but the truth about the cat and the pup
is this: they ate each other up
now what do you really think of that
and that is how i came to know



disturb the street," by isaac watts (1674-1748), are real gems. a few
years ago they were more in favour than the poorer verse that has been
put forward. but they are sure to be revived

once there was a little boy
with curly hair and pleasant eye
a boy who always told the truth
and never, never told a lie

and when he trotted off to school
the children all about would cry
the boy that never tells a lie

and everybody loved him so
because he always told the truth
that every day, as he grew up

and when the people that stood near
would turn to ask the reason why
the answer would be always this


whatever brawls disturb the street
there should be peace at home
where sisters dwell and brothers meet
quarrels should never come

birds in their little nests agree
and 'tis a shameful sight
when children of one family
fall out and chide and fight



oh where! and oh where! is your highland laddie gone
he's gone to fight the french for king george upon the throne
and it's oh! in my heart how i wish him safe at home

oh where! and oh where! does your highland laddie dwell
he dwells in merry scotland at the sign of the bluebell
and it's oh! in my heart that i love my laddie well



if i had but two little wings
and were a little feathery bird
to you i'd fly, my dear
but thoughts like these are idle things
and i stay here

but in my sleep to you i fly
i'm always with you in my sleep
the world is all one's own
all, all alone



to be good

my fairest child, i have no song to give you
no lark could pipe to skies so dull and gray
yet, ere we part, one lesson i can leave you
for every day

be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever
do noble things, not dream them all day long
and so make life, death, and that vast forever
one grand, sweet song



faithful heart, an example of unreasoning obedience. it is right that a
child should obey even to the death the commands of a loving parent

the boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but him had fled
the flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone round him o'er the dead

yet beautiful and bright he stood
as born to rule the storm
a creature of heroic blood
a proud though childlike form

the flames rolled on--he would not go
without his father's word
that father, faint in death below
his voice no longer heard

he called aloud, "say, father, say
if yet my task is done
he knew not that the chieftain lay
unconscious of his son

and but the booming shots replied
and fast the flames rolled on

upon his brow he felt their breath
and in his waving hair
and looked from that lone post of death
in still, yet brave despair

and shouted but once more aloud
while o'er him fast, through sail and shroud
the wreathing fires made way

they wrapt the ship in splendour wild
they caught the flag on high
and streamed above the gallant child
like banners in the sky

then came a burst of thunder sound
the boy--oh! where was he
with fragments strew the sea

with mast, and helm, and pennon fair
that well had borne their part
but the noblest thing that perished there
was that young, faithful heart



with every young audience. it is pointed to an end that children
love--viz., trust in a higher power

we were crowded in the cabin
not a soul would dare to sleep
it was midnight on the waters
and a storm was on the deep

to be shattered by the blast
and to hear the rattling trumpet
thunder, "cut away the mast

so we shuddered there in silence
for the stoutest held his breath
while the hungry sea was roaring
and the breakers talked with death

as thus we sat in darkness
each one busy with his prayers
as he staggered down the stairs

but his little daughter whispered
as she took his icy hand
just the same as on the land

then we kissed the little maiden
and we spoke in better cheer
and we anchored safe in harbour
when the morn was shining clear


time when the chestnut-tree that shaded it was cut down, and then the
children of the place put their pence together and had a chair made for
the poet from its wood


longfellow (1807-82) is truly the children's poet. his poems are as
simple, pathetic, artistic, and philosophical as if they were intended
to tell the plain everyday story of life to older people. "the village
blacksmith" has been learned by thousands of children, and there is no
criticism to be put upon it. the age of the child has nothing whatever
to do with his learning it. age does not grade children nor is poetry
wholly to be so graded. "time is the false reply

under a spreading chestnut-tree
the village smithy stands
the smith, a mighty man is he
with large and sinewy hands
and the muscles of his brawny arms
are strong as iron bands

his hair is crisp, and black, and long
his face is like the tan
his brow is wet with honest sweat
he earns whate'er he can
and looks the whole world in the face
for he owes not any man

week in, week out, from morn till night
you can hear his bellows blow
you can hear him swing his heavy sledge
with measured beat and slow
like a sexton ringing the village bell
when the evening sun is low

and children coming home from school
look in at the open door
they love to see the flaming forge
and hear the bellows roar
and catch the burning sparks that fly
like chaff from a threshing-floor

he goes on sunday to the church
and sits among his boys
he hears the parson pray and preach
he hears his daughter's voice
singing in the village choir
and it makes his heart rejoice

it sounds to him like her mother's voice
singing in paradise
he needs must think of her once more
how in the grave she lies
and with his hard, rough hand he wipes
a tear out of his eyes

toiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing
onward through life he goes
each morning sees some task begin
each evening sees it close
something attempted, something done
has earned a night's repose

thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend
for the lesson thou hast taught
thus at the flaming forge of life
our fortunes must be wrought
thus on its sounding anvil shaped
each burning deed and thought



sweet and low, sweet and low
wind of the western sea
low, low, breathe and blow
wind of the western sea
over the rolling waters go
come from the dropping moon and blow
blow him again to me
while my little one, while my pretty one sleeps

sleep and rest, sleep and rest
father will come to thee soon
rest, rest, on mother's breast
father will come to thee soon
father will come to his babe in the nest
silver sails all out of the west
under the silver moon
sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep



old-fashioned poems, pure poetry and pure violet. it is included in
this volume out of respect to my own love for it when i was a child

down in a green and shady bed
a modest violet grew
its stalk was bent, it hung its head
as if to hide from view

and yet it was a lovely flower
no colours bright and fair
it might have graced a rosy bower
instead of hiding there

yet there it was content to bloom
in modest tints arrayed
and there diffused its sweet perfume
within the silent shade

then let me to the valley go
this pretty flower to see
that i may also learn to grow
in sweet humility




child's feelings. it voices the spirit of all ages that would love to
imagine it "a bridge to heaven

my heart leaps up when i behold
a rainbow in the sky
so was it when my life began
so is it now i am a man
so be it when i shall grow old
or let me die
the child is father of the man
and i could wish my days to be
bound each to each by natural piety



most popular christmas poem ever written. it carries santa claus on
from year to year and the spirit of santa claus

not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
in hopes that st. nicholas soon would be there
the children were nestled all snug in their beds
while visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads
and mamma in her 'kerchief, and i in my cap
had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap
when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
i sprang from the bed to see what was the matter
away to the window i flew like a flash
tore open the shutters and threw up the sash
the moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
gave the luster of mid-day to objects below
when, what to my wondering eyes should appear
but a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer
with a little old driver, so lively and quick
i knew in a moment it must be st. nick
more rapid than eagles his coursers they came
and he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name
on, _comet_! on, _cupid_! on, _donder_ and _blitzen
to the top of the porch! to the top of the wall
now dash away! dash away! dash away all
as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky
so up to the house-top the coursers they flew
with the sleigh full of toys, and st. nicholas, too
and then, in a twinkling, i heard on the roof
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof
as i drew in my head, and was turning around
down the chimney st. nicholas came with a bound
he was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
a bundle of toys he had flung on his back
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack
his eyes--how they twinkled! his dimples how merry
his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow
the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath
he had a broad face and a little round belly
that shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly
he was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
and i laughed when i saw him, in spite of myself
a wink of his eye and a twist of his head
soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread
he spoke not a word, but went straight to his work
and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk
and laying his finger aside of his nose
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose
he sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle
and away they all flew like the down on a thistle
but i heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight



o! say, can you see, by the dawn's early light
what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming
and the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
o! say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave

on that shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
what is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep
as it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses
now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam
in full glory reflected now shines on the stream
o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave

and where is that band who so vauntingly swore
that the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
a home and a country should leave us no more
their blood has washed out their foul footsteps, pollution
no refuge could save the hireling and slave
from the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave
and the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave

o! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
between their loved homes and the war's desolation
blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation
then conquer we must, for our cause it is just
and this be our motto--"_in god is our trust
and the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave



than the original. harmless fun brightens the world. it takes a real
genius to create wit that carries no sting

and yet you incessantly stand on your head
do you think, at your age, it is right

but now that i'm perfectly sure i have none
why, i do it again and again

and have grown most uncommonly fat
yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door
pray, what is the reason of that

by the use of this ointment--one shilling the box
allow me to sell you a couple

for anything tougher than suet
yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak
pray, how did you manage to do it

and argued each case with my wife
and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
has lasted the rest of my life

that your eye was as steady as ever
yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
what made you so awfully clever

said his father, "don't give yourself airs
do you think i can listen all day to such stuff
be off, or i'll kick you down-stairs




teacher of good taste, and i include it at her request

a nightingale, that all day long
had cheered the village with his song
nor yet at eve his note suspended
nor yet when eventide was ended
began to feel, as well he might
the keen demands of appetite
when, looking eagerly around
he spied far off, upon the ground
a something shining in the dark
and knew the glow-worm by his spark
so, stooping down from hawthorn top
he thought to put him in his crop
the worm, aware of his intent
harangued him thus, right eloquent
you would abhor to do me wrong
as much as i to spoil your song
for 'twas the self-same power divine
taught you to sing and me to shine
that you with music, i with light
might beautify and cheer the night
the songster heard his short oration
and warbling out his approbation
released him, as my story tells
and found a supper somewhere else



the little child



years old, but he is the same rollicking fellow to-day as of yore. the
poem puts his merry pranks to the front and prepares the way for
science to give him a true analysis

the frost looked forth, one still, clear night
and whispered, "now i shall be out of sight
so through the valley and over the height
in silence i'll take my way
i will not go on with that blustering train
the wind and the snow, the hail and the rain
who make so much bustle and noise in vain
but i'll be as busy as they

then he flew to the mountain and powdered its crest
he lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed
in diamond beads--and over the breast
of the quivering lake he spread
a coat of mail, that it need not fear
the downward point of many a spear
that hung on its margin far and near
where a rock could rear its head

he went to the windows of those who slept
and over each pane, like a fairy, crept
wherever he breathed, wherever he slept
by the light of the moon were seen
most beautiful things--there were flowers and trees
there were bevies of birds and swarms of bees
there were cities with temples and towers, and these
all pictured in silver sheen

but he did one thing that was hardly fair
he peeped in the cupboard, and finding there
that all had forgotten for him to prepare
i'll bite this basket of fruit," said he
and the glass of water they've left for me
shall '_tchich!_' to tell them i'm drinking



when cats run home and light is come
and dew is cold upon the ground
and the far-off stream is dumb
and the whirring sail goes round
and the whirring sail goes round
alone and warming his five wits
the white owl in the belfry sits

when merry milkmaids click the latch
and rarely smells the new-mown hay
and the cock hath sung beneath the thatch
twice or thrice his roundelay
twice or thrice his roundelay
alone and warming his five wits
the white owl in the belfry sits



place here because it carries a good lesson good-naturedly rendered. an
accomplished teacher recommends it, and i recollect two young children
in chicago who sang it frequently for years without getting tired of

there were three sailors of bristol city
who took a boat and went to sea
but first with beef and captain's biscuits
and pickled pork they loaded she

there was gorging jack and guzzling jimmy
and the youngest he was little billee
now when they got so far as the equator
they'd nothing left but one split pea

there's little bill, he's young and tender
we're old and tough, so let's eat he

so undo the button of your chemie
when bill received this information
he used his pocket-handkerchie

which my poor mammy taught to me
while jack pulled out his snickersnee

so billy went up to the main-topgallant mast
and down he fell on his bended knee
he scarce had come to the twelfth commandment
when up he jumps, "there's land i see

there's the british flag a-riding at anchor

so when they got aboard of the admiral's
he hanged fat jack and flogged jimmee
but as for little bill, he made him

methought i heard a butterfly
say to a labouring bee
on painted wings like me

and colours bright and rare
with mild reproof, the bee replies

and scorning idleness
to tribes of gaudy sloth i leave
the vanity of dress



included in this volume out of regard to a boy of eight years who did
not care for many poems, but this one stirred his heart to its depths

you know, we french storm'd ratisbon
a mile or so away
on a little mound, napoleon
stood on our storming-day
with neck out-thrust, you fancy how
legs wide, arms lock'd behind
as if to balance the prone brow
oppressive with its mind

just as perhaps he mus'd "my plans
that soar, to earth may fall
let once my army leader lannes
waver at yonder wall
out 'twixt the battery smokes there flew
a rider, bound on bound
full-galloping; nor bridle drew
until he reach'd the mound

then off there flung in smiling joy
and held himself erect
by just his horse's mane, a boy
you hardly could suspect
scarce any blood came through
you look'd twice ere you saw his breast
was all but shot in two

we've got you ratisbon
the marshal's in the market-place
and you'll be there anon
to see your flag-bird flap his vans
where i, to heart's desire
perched him!" the chief's eye flashed; his plans
soared up again like fire

the chief's eye flashed; but presently
softened itself, as sheathes
a film the mother-eagle's eye
when her bruised eaglet breathes
touched to the quick, he said
smiling the boy fell dead



have seen it used effectively as a memory gem in the cook county normal
school (colonel parker's school), year after year, and because my own
pupils invariably like to commit it to memory. with the child of six to

nice good wife that never goes out
keeping house while i frolic about
chee, chee, chee

soon as the little ones chip the shell
six wide mouths are open for food
robert of lincoln bestirs him well
gathering seeds for the hungry brood
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
this new life is likely to be
hard for a gay young fellow like me
chee, chee, chee

robert of lincoln at length is made
sober with work, and silent with care
off is his holiday garment laid
half forgotten that merry air
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
where our nest and our nestlings lie
chee, chee, chee

summer wanes; the children are grown
fun and frolic no more he knows
robert of lincoln's a hum-drum drone
off he flies, and we sing as he goes
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
when you can pipe that merry old strain
robert of lincoln, come back again
chee, chee, chee



course for its sparkle and glow

old grimes is dead; that good old man
we ne'er shall see him more
he used to wear a long, black coat
all buttoned down before

his heart was open as the day
his feelings all were true
his hair was some inclined to gray
he wore it in a queue

he lived at peace with all mankind
in friendship he was true
his coat had pocket-holes behind
his pantaloons were blue

he modest merit sought to find
and pay it its desert
he had no malice in his mind
no ruffles on his shirt

his neighbours he did not abuse
was sociable and gay
he wore large buckles on his shoes
and changed them every day

his knowledge, hid from public gaze
he did not bring to view
nor make a noise town-meeting days
as many people do

his worldly goods he never threw
in trust to fortune's chances
but lived (as all his brothers do
in easy circumstances

thus undisturbed by anxious cares
his peaceful moments ran
and everybody said he was
a fine old gentleman



a traveller on a dusty road
strewed acorns on the lea
and one took root and sprouted up
and grew into a tree
love sought its shade at evening-time
to breathe its early vows
and age was pleased, in heights of noon
to bask beneath its boughs
the dormouse loved its dangling twigs
the birds sweet music bore
it stood a glory in its place
a blessing evermore

a little spring had lost its way
amid the grass and fern
a passing stranger scooped a well
where weary men might turn
he walled it in, and hung with care
a ladle on the brink
he thought not of the deed he did
but judged that toil might drink
he passed again; and lo! the well
by summer never dried
had cooled ten thousand parchéd tongues
and saved a life beside

a nameless man, amid the crowd
that thronged the daily mart
let fall a word of hope and love
unstudied from the heart
a whisper on the tumult thrown
a transitory breath
it raised a brother from the dust
it saved a soul from death
o germ! o fount! o word of love
o thought at random cast
ye were but little at the first
but mighty at the last



shed no tear! o shed no tear
the flower will bloom another year
weep no more! o, weep no more
young buds sleep in the root's white core
dry your eyes! oh! dry your eyes
for i was taught in paradise
to ease my breast of melodies
shed no tear

overhead! look overhead
look up, look up. i flutter now
on this flush pomegranate bough
see me! 'tis this silvery bell
ever cures the good man's ill
shed no tear! o, shed no tear
the flowers will bloom another year
adieu, adieu--i fly, adieu
i vanish in the heaven's blue
adieu, adieu



attractive to children

where the pools are bright and deep
where the gray trout lies asleep
up the river and o'er the lea
that's the way for billy and me

where the blackbird sings the latest
where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest
where the nestlings chirp and flee
that's the way for billy and me

where the mowers mow the cleanest
where the hay lies thick and greenest
there to trace the homeward bee
that's the way for billy and me

where the hazel bank is steepest
where the shadow falls the deepest
where the clustering nuts fall free
that's the way for billy and me

why the boys should drive away
little sweet maidens from the play
or love to banter and fight so well
that's the thing i never could tell

but this i know, i love to play
through the meadow, among the hay
up the water and o'er the lea
that's the way for billy and me



buttercups and daisies
oh, the pretty flowers
coming ere the spring time
to tell of sunny hours
while the tree are leafless
while the fields are bare
buttercups and daisies
spring up here and there

ere the snowdrop peepeth
ere the crocus bold
ere the early primrose
opes its paly gold
somewhere on the sunny bank
buttercups are bright
somewhere 'mong the frozen grass
peeps the daisy white

little hardy flowers
like to children poor
playing in their sturdy health
by their mother's door
purple with the north wind
yet alert and bold
fearing not, and caring not
though they be a-cold

what to them is winter
what are stormy showers
buttercups and daisies
are these human flowers
he who gave them hardships
and a life of care
gave them likewise hardy strength
and patient hearts to bear



triumphal arch, that fills the sky
when storms prepare to part
i ask not proud philosophy
to teach me what thou art

still seem, as to my childhood's sight
a midway station given
for happy spirits to alight
betwixt the earth and heaven



readily. children are untouched by the commercial spirit which is the
reproach of this age. "ingratitude is the vice of republics," and this
poem puts to shame the love of money and the spirit of ingratitude that
could let a national servant become a wreck

ay, tear her tattered ensign down
long has it waved on high
and many an eye has danced to see
that banner in the sky
beneath it rung the battle shout
and burst the cannon's roar
the meteor of the ocean air
shall sweep the clouds no more

her deck, once red with heroes' blood
where knelt the vanquished foe
when winds were hurrying o'er the flood
and waves were white below
no more shall feel the victor's tread
or know the conquered knee
the harpies of the shore shall pluck
the eagle of the sea

o, better that her shattered hulk
should sink beneath the wave
her thunders shook the mighty deep
and there should be her grave
nail to the mast her holy flag
set every threadbare sail
and give her to the god of storms
the lightning and the gale



has "washed the dishes," "swept up the crumbs," "driven the chickens
from the porch," and done all the other odds and ends of work on a
farm. the poet, james whitcomb riley (1853-), has shown how truly a
little child may be overtaxed and yet preserve a brave spirit and keen
imagination. children invariably love to learn this poem

little orphant annie's come to our house to stay
an' wash the cups and saucers up, an' brush the crumbs away
an' shoo the chickens off the porch, an' dust the hearth, an' sweep
an' make the fire, an' bake the bread, an' earn her board-an'-keep
an' all us other children, when the supper things is done
we set around the kitchen fire an' has the mostest fun
a-list'nin' to the witch-tales 'at annie tells about
an' the gobble-uns 'at gits you
ef you
don't
watch

onc't they was a little boy wouldn't say his pray'rs
an' when he went to bed at night, away up-stairs
his mammy heerd him holler, an' his daddy heerd him bawl
an' when they turn't the kivvers down, he wasn't there at all
an' they seeked him in the rafter-room, an' cubby hole, an' press
an' seeked him up the chimbly flue, an' ever'-wheres, i guess
but all they ever found was thist his pants an' roundabout
an' the gobble-uns'll git you
ef you
don't
watch

an' one time a little girl 'ud allus laugh an' grin
an' make fun of ever' one, an' all her blood-an'-kin
an' onc't when they was "company," an' ole folks was there
she mocked 'em an' shocked 'em, an' said she didn't care
an' thist as she kicked her heels, an' turn't to run an' hide
they was two great big black things a-standin' by her side
an' they snatched her through the ceilin' 'fore she
knowed what she's about
an' the gobble-uns'll git you
ef you
don't
watch

an' little orphant annie says, when the blaze is blue
an' the lampwick sputters, an' the wind goes woo-oo
an' you hear the crickets quit, an' the moon is gray
an' the lightnin'-bugs in dew is all squenched away
you better mind yer parents, an' yer teachers fond an' dear
an' churish them 'at loves you, an' dry the orphant's tear
an' he'p the pore an' needy ones 'at clusters all about
er the gobble-uns'll git you

of compliment to a little boy aged ten who wanted to recite it once a
week for a year. this song and edwin markham's poem on lincoln are two
of the greatest tributes ever paid to that hero

o captain! my captain! our fearful trip is done
the ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won
the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting
while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring
but o heart! heart! heart
o the bleeding drops of red
where on the deck my captain lies
fallen cold and dead

o captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells
rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills
for you bouquets and ribboned wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding
for you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning
here captain! dear father
this arm beneath your head
it is some dream that on the deck
you've fallen cold and dead

my captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still
my father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will
the ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done
from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won
exult o shores, and ring o bells
but i, with mournful tread
walk the deck my captain lies
fallen cold and dead



thrust at a refined vice. it is a part of education to learn to be
grateful

blow, blow, thou winter wind
thou are not so unkind
as man's ingratitude
thy tooth is not so keen
because thou are not seen
although thy breath be rude

freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky
thou dost not bite so nigh
as benefits forgot
though thou the waters warp
thy sting is not so sharp
as friend remembered not



honour of a hardy plant. there is a wonderful ivy growing at rhudlan
in northern wales. its roots are so large and strong that they form a
comfortable seat for many persons, and no one can remember when they
were smaller. this ivy envelops a great castle in ruins. every child in
that locality loves the old ivy. it is typical of the ivy as seen all
through wales and england

o, a dainty plant is the ivy green
that creepeth o'er ruins old
of right choice food are his meals, i ween
in his cell so lone and cold
the walls must be crumbled, the stones decayed
to pleasure his dainty whim
and the mouldering dust that years have made
is a merry meal for him
creeping where no life is seen
a rare old plant is the ivy green

fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings
and a staunch old heart has he
how closely he twineth, how tight he clings
to his friend, the huge oak tree
and slyly he traileth along the ground
and his leaves he gently waves
and he joyously twines and hugs around
the rich mould of dead men's graves
creeping where no life is seen
a rare old plant is the ivy green

whole ages have fled, and their works decayed
and nations have scattered been
but the stout old ivy shall never fade
from its hale and hearty green
the brave old plant in its lonely days
shall fatten upon the past
for the stateliest building man can raise
is the ivy's food at last
creeping where no life is seen
a rare old plant is the ivy green



virtue well polished is better than none

it is not growing like a tree
in bulk doth make man better be
or standing long an oak, three hundred year
to fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sear
a lily of a day
is fairer far in may
although it fall and die that night
it was the plant and flower of light
in small proportions we just beauties see
and in short measures life may perfect be



his way into scores of hearts by his mad pranks and affectionate ways
it is enough that john burroughs has commended the poem

of all the woodland creatures
the quaintest little sprite
is the dainty flying squirrel
in vest of shining white
in coat of silver gray
and vest of shining white

his furry quaker jacket
is trimmed with stripe of black
a furry plume to match it
is curling o'er his back
new curved with every motion
his plume curls o'er his back

no little new-born baby
has pinker feet than he
each tiny toe is cushioned
with velvet cushions three
three wee, pink, velvet cushions
almost too small to see

who said, "the foot of baby
might tempt an angel's kiss
i know a score of school-boys
who put their lips to this
this wee foot of the squirrel
and left a loving kiss

the tiny thief has hidden
my candy and my plum
ah, there he comes unbidden
to gently nip my thumb
down in his home (my pocket
he gently nips my thumb

how strange the food he covets
the restless, restless wight
fred's old stuffed armadillo
he found a tempting bite
fred's old stuffed armadillo
with ears a perfect fright

the lady ruth's great bureau
each foot a dragon's paw
the midget ate the nails from
his famous antique claw
oh, what a cruel beastie
to hurt a dragon's claw

to autographic copies
upon my choicest shelf
to every dainty volume
the rogue has helped himself
my books! oh dear! no matter
the rogue has helped himself

and yet, my little squirrel
your taste is not so bad
you've swallowed caird completely
and psychologic ladd
rosmini you've digested
and kant in rags you've clad

gnaw on, my elfish rodent
lay all the sages low
my pretty lace and ribbons
they're yours for weal or woe
my pocket-book's in tatters
because you like it so



there is never a boy who objects to learning "warren's address," by
john pierpont (1785-1866). to stand by one's own rights is inherent in
every true american. this poem is doubtless developed from robert
burns's "bannockburn." (1785-1866

stand! the ground's your own, my braves
will ye give it up to slaves
will ye look for greener graves
hope ye mercy still
what's the mercy despots feel
hear it in that battle-peal
read it on yon bristling steel
ask it,--ye who will

fear ye foes who kill for hire
will ye to your homes retire
look behind you! they're afire
and, before you, see
who have done it!--from the vale
on they come!--and will ye quail
leaden rain and iron hail
let their welcome be

in the god of battles trust
die we may,--and die we must
but, o, where can dust to dust
be consigned so well
as where heaven its dews shall shed
on the martyred patriot's bed
and the rocks shall raise their head
of his deeds to tell



and girls are concerned. it is a most valuable poem. i once heard a
clergyman in chicago use it as a text for his sermon. since then "annie
laurie" has become the song of the labour party. "the song in camp
voices a universal feeling. (1825-78

the outer trenches guarding
when the heated guns of the camps allied
grew weary of bombarding

the dark redan, in silent scoff
lay, grim and threatening, under
and the tawny mound of the malakoff
no longer belched its thunder

there was a pause. a guardsman said
sing while we may, another day
will bring enough of sorrow

they lay along the battery's side
below the smoking cannon
brave hearts, from severn and from clyde
and from the banks of shannon

they sang of love, and not of fame
forgot was britain's glory
each heart recalled a different name
but all sang "annie laurie

voice after voice caught up the song
until its tender passion
rose like an anthem, rich and strong
their battle-eve confession

dear girl, her name he dared not speak
but, as the song grew louder
something upon the soldier's cheek
washed off the stains of powder

beyond the darkening ocean burned
the bloody sunset's embers
while the crimean valleys learned
how english love remembers

and once again a fire of hell
rained on the russian quarters
with scream of shot, and burst of shell
and bellowing of the mortars

and irish nora's eyes are dim
for a singer, dumb and gory
and english mary mourns for him
who sang of "annie laurie

sleep, soldiers! still in honoured rest
your truth and valour wearing
the bravest are the tenderest
the loving are the daring



its central theme the undying power of human love. the music is notable
for sweetness and delicacy

the splendour falls on castle walls
and snowy summits old in story
the long light shakes across the lakes
and the wild cataract leaps in glory
blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying
blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying

o hark, o hear! how thin and clear
and thinner, clearer, farther going
o sweet and far from cliff and scar
the horns of elfland faintly blowing
blow, let us hear the purple glens replying
blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying

o love, they die in yon rich sky
they faint on hill or field or river
our echoes roll from soul to soul
and grow forever and forever
blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying
and answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying



too highly for its ethical value. children always love to learn it
after hearing it read correctly and by one who understands and
appreciates it. "stand by" is the motto. my pupils teach it to me once
a year and learn it themselves, too

beneath the low-hung night cloud
that raked her splintering mast
the good ship settled slowly
the cruel leak gained fast

over the awful ocean
her signal guns pealed out
dear god! was that thy answer
from the horror round about

a voice came down the wild wind
shall stand till daylight by

hour after hour crept slowly
yet on the heaving swells
tossed up and down the ship-lights
the lights of the _three bells

and ship to ship made signals
man answered back to man
while oft, to cheer and hearten
the _three bells_ nearer ran

and the captain from her taffrail
sent down his hopeful cry

all night across the waters
the tossing lights shone clear
all night from reeling taffrail
the _three bells_ sent her cheer

and when the dreary watches
of storm and darkness passed
just as the wreck lurched under
all souls were saved at last

sail on, _three bells_, forever
in grateful memory sail
ring on, _three bells_ of rescue
above the wave and gale

type of the love eternal
repeat the master's cry
as tossing through our darkness
the lights of god draw nigh



buchanan read (1822-72). the swing and gallop in it take every boy off
from his feet. the children never teach this poem to me, because they
love to learn it at first sight. it is easily memorised

up from the south at break of day
bringing to winchester fresh dismay
the affrighted air with a shudder bore
like a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door
the terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar
telling the battle was on once more
and sheridan twenty miles away

and wider still those billows of war
thundered along the horizon's bar
and louder yet into winchester rolled
the roar of that red sea uncontrolled
making the blood of the listener cold
as he thought of the stake in that fiery fray
and sheridan twenty miles away

but there is a road from winchester town
a good, broad highway leading down
and there, through the flush of the morning light
a steed as black as the steeds of night
was seen to pass as with eagle flight
as if he knew the terrible need
he stretched away with his utmost speed
hills rose and fell; but his heart was gay
with sheridan fifteen miles away

still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering south
the dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth
or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster
foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster
the heart of the steed and the heart of the master
were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls
impatient to be where the battle-field calls
every nerve of the charger was strained to full play
with sheridan only ten miles away

under his spurning feet the road
like an arrowy alpine river flowed
and the landscape sped away behind
like an ocean flying before the wind
and the steed, like a bark fed with furnace fire
swept on, with his wild eye full of ire
but lo! he is nearing his heart's desire
he is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray
with sheridan only five miles away

the first that the general saw were the groups
of stragglers, and then the retreating troops
what was done--what to do? a glance told him both
then striking his spurs, with a terrible oath
he dashed down the line, mid a storm of huzzas
and the wave of retreat checked its course there, because
the sight of the master compelled it to pause
with foam and with dust the black charger was gray
by the flash of his eye, and the red nostrils' play
he seemed to the whole great army to say
from winchester down to save the day

hurrah! hurrah for sheridan
hurrah! hurrah for horse and man
and when their statues are placed on high
under the dome of the union sky
the american soldiers' temple of fame
there with the glorious general's name
be it said, in letters both bold and bright
by carrying sheridan into the fight
from winchester, twenty miles away



goodly percentage of the children who read it want to learn it

across the lonely beach we flit
and fast i gather, bit by bit
the scattered driftwood, bleached and dry
the wild waves reach their hands for it
the wild wind raves, the tide runs high
as up and down the beach we flit

above our heads the sullen clouds
scud, black and swift, across the sky
like silent ghosts in misty shrouds
stand out the white lighthouses high
almost as far as eye can reach
i see the close-reefed vessels fly
as fast we flit along the beach

i watch him as he skims along
uttering his sweet and mournful cry
he starts not at my fitful song
nor flash of fluttering drapery
he has no thought of any wrong
he scans me with a fearless eye
stanch friends are we, well tried and strong

comrade, where wilt thou be to-night
when the loosed storm breaks furiously
my driftwood fire will burn so bright
to what warm shelter canst thou fly
i do not fear for thee, though wroth
the tempest rushes through the sky
for are we not god's children both



girls always love "lady clare" and "the lord of burleigh." they like to
think that it is enough to be a splendid woman without title or wealth
they want to be loved, if they are loved at all, for their good hearts
and graces of mind. tennyson (1809-92) makes this point repeatedly
through his poems

it was the time when lilies blow
and clouds are highest up in air
lord ronald brought a lily-white doe
to give his cousin, lady clare

i trow they did not part in scorn
lovers long-betroth'd were they
they too will wed the morrow morn
god's blessing on the day

nor for my lands so broad and fair
he loves me for my own true worth
and that is well," said lady clare

in there came old alice the nurse
said: "who was this that went from thee

lord ronald is heir of all your lands
and you are not the lady clare

said lady clare, "that ye speak so wild

i speak the truth, as i live by bread
i buried her like my own sweet child
and put my child in her stead

o mother," she said, "if this be true
to keep the best man under the sun
so many years from his due

and all you have will be lord ronald's
when you are man and wife

pull off, pull off the brooch of gold
and fling the diamond necklace by

she said: "not so: but i will know
if there be any faith in man


alas! my child, i sinn'd for thee

my mother dear, if this be so
and lay your hand upon my head
and bless me, mother, ere i go

she clad herself in a russet gown
she was no longer lady clare
she went by dale, and she went by down
with a single rose in her hair

the lily-white doe lord ronald had brought
leapt up from where she lay
dropt her head in the maiden's hand
and follow'd her all the way

down stept lord ronald from his tower
why come you drest like a village maid
that are the flower of the earth

i am but as my fortunes are
i am a beggar born," she said

play me no tricks," said lord ronald

o and proudly stood she up
her heart within her did not fail
she look'd into lord ronald's eyes
and told him all her nurse's tale

he laugh'd a laugh of merry scorn
he turn'd and kiss'd her where she stood
and i," said he, "the next in blood

and i," said he, "the lawful heir
we two will wed to-morrow morn
and you shall still be lady clare



in her ear he whispers gaily
maiden, i have watched thee daily
and i think thou lov'st me well
she replies, in accents fainter
he is but a landscape-painter
and a village maiden she

he to lips, that fondly falter
presses his without reproof
leads her to the village altar
and they leave her father's roof

little can i give my wife
love will make our cottage pleasant
and i love thee more than life

they by parks and lodges going
see the lordly castles stand
summer woods, about them blowing
made a murmur in the land

from deep thought himself he rouses
says to her that loves him well
where the wealthy nobles dwell

so she goes by him attended
hears him lovingly converse
sees whatever fair and splendid
lay betwixt his home and hers

parks with oak and chestnut shady
parks and order'd gardens great
ancient homes of lord and lady
built for pleasure and for state

all he shows her makes him dearer
evermore she seems to gaze
on that cottage growing nearer
where they twain will spend their days

o but she will love him truly
he shall have a cheerful home
she will order all things duly
when beneath his roof they come

thus her heart rejoices greatly
till a gateway she discerns
with armorial bearings stately
and beneath the gate she turns
sees a mansion more majestic
than all those she saw before
many a gallant gay domestic
bows before him at the door

and they speak in gentle murmur
when they answer to his call
while he treads with footstep firmer
leading on from hall to hall

and while now she wanders blindly
nor the meaning can divine
proudly turns he round and kindly

here he lives in state and bounty
lord of burleigh, fair and free
not a lord in all the county
is so great a lord as he
all at once the colour flushes
her sweet face from brow to chin
as it were with same she blushes
and her spirit changed within

then her countenance all over
pale again as death did prove
but he clasp'd her like a lover
and he cheer'd her soul with love

so she strove against her weakness
tho' at times her spirits sank
shaped her heart with woman's meekness
to all duties of her rank
and a gentle consort made he
and her gentle mind was such
that she grew a noble lady
and the people loved her much
but a trouble weigh'd upon her
and perplex'd her, night and morn
with the burden of an honour
unto which she was not born

faint she grew and ever fainter
as she murmur'd, "oh, that he
were once more that landscape-painter
which did win my heart from me

so she droop'd and droop'd before him
fading slowly from his side
three fair children first she bore him
then before her time she died

weeping, weeping late and early
walking up and pacing down
deeply mourn'd the lord of burleigh
burleigh-house by stamford-town

and he came to look upon her
and he look'd at her and said
that she wore when she was wed

then her people, softly treading
bore to earth her body, drest
in the dress that she was wed in
that her spirit might have rest



our land know snatches of it it is a child's poem, every line of it
one summer in boston more than 50,000 people went to take a peep at the
poet's house. (1807-82

by the shores of gitche gumee
by the shining big-sea-water
stood the wigwam of nokomis
daughter of the moon, nokomis
dark behind it rose the forest
rose the black and gloomy pine-trees
rose the firs with cones upon them
bright before it beat the water
beat the clear and sunny water
beat the shining big-sea-water

there the wrinkled old nokomis
nursed the little hiawatha
rocked him in his linden cradle
bedded soft in moss and rushes
safely bound with reindeer sinews
stilled his fretful wail by saying
lulled him into slumber, singing
who is this that lights the wigwam
with his great eyes lights the wigwam
ewa-yea! my little owlet

many things nokomis taught him
of the stars that shine in heaven
showed him ishkoodah, the comet
ishkoodah, with fiery tresses
showed the death-dance of the spirits
warriors with their plumes and war-clubs
flaring far away to northward
in the frosty nights of winter
showed the broad, white road in heaven
pathway of the ghosts, the shadows
running straight across the heavens
crowded with the ghosts, the shadows

at the door, on summer evenings
sat the little hiawatha
heard the whispering of the pine-trees
heard the lapping of the water
sounds of music, words of wonder
saw the fire-fly, wah-wah-taysee
flitting through the dusk of evening
with the twinkle of its candle
lighting up the brakes and bushes
and he sang the song of children
sang the song nokomis taught him
little, flitting, white-fire insect
little, dancing, white-fire creature
light me with your little candle
ere upon my bed i lay me
ere in sleep i close my eyelids

saw the moon rise from the water
rippling, rounding from the water
saw the flecks and shadows on it
whispered, "what is that, nokomis
and the good nokomis answered
seized his grandmother, and threw her
up into the sky at midnight
right against the moon he threw her

saw the rainbow in the heaven
in the eastern sky, the rainbow
whispered, "what is that, nokomis
and the good nokomis answered
all the wild-flowers of the forest
all the lilies of the prairie
when on earth they fade and perish
blossom in that heaven above us

when he heard the owls at midnight
hooting, laughing in the forest
and the good nokomis answered
talking in their native language
talking, scolding at each other

then the little hiawatha
learned of every bird its language
learned their names and all their secrets
how they built their nests in summer
where they hid themselves in winter
talked with them whene'er he met them
called them "hiawatha's chickens

of all beasts he learned the language
learned their names and all their secrets
how the beavers built their lodges
where the squirrels hid their acorns
how the reindeer ran so swiftly
why the rabbit was so timid
talked with them whene'er he met them
called them "hiawatha's brothers



splendid teacher at poughkeepsie. i found the pupils learning the poem
the teacher having placed a bunch of daffodils in a vase before them
it was a charming lesson. (1770-96

i wandered lonely as a cloud
that floats on high o'er vales and hills
when all at once i saw a crowd
a host of golden daffodils
beside the lake, beneath the trees
fluttering and dancing in the breeze

continuous as the stars that shine
and twinkle on the milky way
they stretched in never-ending line
along the margin of a bay
ten thousand saw i at a glance
tossing their heads in sprightly dance

the waves beside them danced, but they
outdid the sparkling waves in glee
a poet could not but be gay
in such a jocund company
i gazed--and gazed--but little thought
what wealth the show to me had brought

for oft, when on my couch i lie
in vacant or in pensive mood
they flash upon that inward eye
which is the bliss of solitude
and then my heart with pleasure fills
and dances with the daffodils



successful struggle. one editor has made a temperance poem of it
mistaking its true intent. the poem is a strong expression of a
plow-man's love for a hardy, food-giving grain which has sprung to life
through his efforts. (1759-96

there were three kings into the east
three kings both great and high
and they ha'e sworn a solemn oath
john barleycorn should die

they took a plow and plowed him down
put clods upon his head
and they ha'e sworn a solemn oath
john barleycorn was dead

but the cheerful spring came kindly on
and showers began to fall
john barleycorn got up again
and sore surprised them all

the sultry suns of summer came
and he grew thick and strong
his head well arm'd wi' pointed spears
that no one should him wrong

the sober autumn entered mild
and he grew wan and pale
his bending joints and drooping head
showed he began to fail

his colour sickened more and more
he faded into age
and then his enemies began
to show their deadly rage

they took a weapon long and sharp
and cut him by the knee
then tied him fast upon a cart
like a rogue for forgery

they laid him down upon his back
and cudgelled him full sore
they hung him up before the storm
and turn'd him o'er and o'er

they filled up then a darksome pit
with water to the brim
and heaved in poor john barleycorn
to let him sink or swim

they laid him out upon the floor
to work him further woe
and still as signs of life appeared
they tossed him to and fro

they wasted o'er a scorching flame
the marrow of his bones
but a miller used him worst of all
he crushed him 'tween two stones

and they have taken his very heart's blood
and drunk it round and round
and still the more and more they drank
their joy did more abound



and motion of the water of the great ocean. children remember it almost
unconsciously after hearing it read several times

a life on the ocean wave
a home on the rolling deep
where the scattered waters rave
and the winds their revels keep
like an eagle caged, i pine
on this dull, unchanging shore
oh! give me the flashing brine
the spray and the tempest's roar

once more on the deck i stand
of my own swift-gliding craft
set sail! farewell to the land
the gale follows fair abaft
we shoot through the sparkling foam
like an ocean-bird set free
like the ocean-bird, our home
we'll find far out on the sea

the land is no longer in view
the clouds have begun to frown
but with a stout vessel and crew
we'll say, let the storm come down
and the song of our hearts shall be
while the winds and the waters rave
a home on the rolling sea
a life on the ocean wave



it is customary, every new year's eve in america, to ring bells, fire
guns, send up rockets, and, in many other ways, to show joy and
gratitude that the old year has been so kind, and that the new year is
so auspicious. the emphasis in tennyson's poem is laid on gratitude for
past benefits so easily forgotten rather than upon the possible
advantages of the unknown and untried future

full knee-deep lies the winter snow
and the winter winds are wearily sighing
toll ye the church-bell sad and slow
and tread softly and speak low
for the old year lies a-dying
old year, you must not die
you came to us so readily
you lived with us so steadily
old year, you shall not die

he lieth still: he doth not move
he will not see the dawn of day
he hath no other life above
he gave me a friend, and a true true-love
and the new-year will take 'em away
old year, you must not go
so long as you have been with us
such joy as you have seen with us
old year, you shall not go

he froth'd his bumpers to the brim
a jollier year we shall not see
but tho' his eyes are waxing dim
and tho' his foes speak ill of him
he was a friend to me
old year, you shall not die
we did so laugh and cry with you
i've half a mind to die with you
old year, if you must die

he was full of joke and jest
but all his merry quips are o'er
to see him die, across the waste
his son and heir doth ride post-haste
but he'll be dead before
every one for his own
the night is starry and cold, my friend
and the new-year blithe and bold, my friend
comes up to take his own

how hard he breathes! over the snow
i heard just now the crowing cock
the shadows flicker to and fro
the cricket chirps: the light burns low
shake hands, before you die
old year, we'll dearly rue for you
what is it we can do for you
speak out before you die

his face is growing sharp and thin
alack! our friend is gone
close up his eyes: tie up his chin
step from the corpse, and let him in
that standeth there alone
and waiteth at the door
there's a new foot on the floor, my friend
and a new face at the door, my friend
a new face at the door




abou ben adhem (may his tribe increase
awoke one night from a deep dream of peace
and saw within the moonlight in his room
making it rich and like a lily in bloom
an angel writing in a book of gold

exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold
and to the presence in the room he said
and, with a look made of all sweet accord
answered, "the names of those who love the lord

replied the angel. abou spoke more low
but cheerly still; and said, "i pray thee, then
write me as one that loves his fellow-men

the angel wrote, and vanished. the next night
it came again, with a great wakening light
and showed the names whom love of god had blessed
and, lo! ben adhem's name led all the rest



reader. how the boys and girls loved it! the author, j.t. trowbridge
poem is just as popular as it ever was

over the hill the farm-boy goes
his shadow lengthens along the land
a giant staff in a giant hand
in the poplar-tree, above the spring
the katydid begins to sing
the early dews are falling
into the stone-heap darts the mink
the swallows skim the river's brink
and home to the woodland fly the crows
when over the hill the farm-boy goes
cheerily calling
farther, farther over the hill
faintly calling, calling still

into the yard the farmer goes
with grateful heart, at the close of day
harness and chain are hung away
in the wagon-shed stand yoke and plow
the straw's in the stack, the hay in the mow
the cooling dews are falling
the friendly sheep his welcome bleat
the pigs come grunting to his feet
the whinnying mare her master knows
when into the yard the farmer goes
his cattle calling
while still the cow-boy, far away
goes seeking those that have gone astray

now to her task the milkmaid goes
the cattle come crowding through the gate
lowing, pushing, little and great
about the trough, by the farm-yard pump
the frolicsome yearlings frisk and jump
while the pleasant dews are falling
the new-milch heifer is quick and shy
but the old cow waits with tranquil eye
and the white stream into the bright pail flows
when to her task the milkmaid goes
soothingly calling
the cheerful milkmaid takes her stool
and sits and milks in the twilight cool
saying, "so! so, boss! so! so

to supper at last the farmer goes
the apples are pared, the paper read
the stories are told, then all to bed
without, the crickets' ceaseless song
makes shrill the silence all night long
the heavy dews are falling
the housewife's hand has turned the lock
drowsily ticks the kitchen clock
the household sinks to deep repose
but still in sleep the farm-boy goes
singing, calling
and oft the milkmaid, in her dreams
drums in the pail with the flashing streams
murmuring, "so, boss! so



on turning up her nest with the plow, november, 1785

the ineffable touches of tenderness that illumine the sturdy plowman
the contrast between the strong man and the delicate flower or creature
at his mercy makes tenderness in man a vital point in character

the lines "to a mouse" seem by report to have been composed while burns
was actually plowing. one of the poet's first editors wrote: "john
blane, who had acted as gaudsman to burns, and who lived sixty years
afterward, had a distinct recollection of the turning up of the mouse
like a thoughtless youth as he was, he ran after the creature to kill
it, but was checked and recalled by his master, who he observed became
thereafter thoughtful and abstracted. burns, who treated his servants
with the familiarity of fellow-labourers, soon afterward read the poem
to blane

wee, sleekit, cow'rin', tim'rous beastie
oh, what a panic's in thy breastie
thou needna start awa' sae hasty
wi' bickering brattle
i wad be laith to rin and chase thee
wi' murd'ring pattle

i'm truly sorry man's dominion
has broken nature's social union
and justifies that ill opinion
which makes thee startle
at me, thy poor earth-born companion
and fellow-mortal

i doubtna, whiles, but thou may thieve
what then? poor beastie, thou maun live
a daimen icker in a thrave
i'll get a blessin' wi' the lave
and never miss 't

thy wee bit housie, too, in ruin
its silly wa's the win's are strewin
and naething now to big a new ane
o' foggage green
and bleak december's winds ensuin
baith snell and keen

thou saw the fields laid bare and waste
and weary winter comin' fast
and cozie here, beneath the blast
thou thought to dwell
till, crash! the cruel coulter passed
out through thy cell

that wee bit heap o' leaves and stibble
has cost thee monie a weary nibble
now thou's turned out for a' thy trouble
but house or hald
to thole the winter's sleety dribble
and cranreuch cauld

but, mousie, thou art no thy lane
in proving foresight may be vain
the best-laid schemes o' mice and men
gang aft a-gley
and lea'e us naught but grief and pain
for promised joy

still thou art blest, compared wi' me
the present only toucheth thee
but, och! i backward cast my e'e
on prospects drear
and forward, though i canna see
i guess and fear



on turning one down with the plow in april, 1786

wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower
thou's met me in an evil hour
for i maun crush amang the stoure
thy slender stem
to spare thee now is past my power
thou bonny gem

alas! it's no thy neebor sweet
the bonny lark, companion meet
bending thee 'mang the dewy weet
wi' speckled breast
when upward-springing, blithe, to greet
the purpling east

cauld blew the bitter biting north
upon thy early, humble birth
yet cheerfully thou glinted forth
amid the storm
scarce reared above the parent earth
thy tender form

the flaunting flowers our gardens yield
high sheltering woods and wa's maun shield
but thou, beneath the random bield
o' clod or stane
adorns the histie stibble-field
unseen, alane

there, in thy scanty mantle clad
thy snawie bosom sunward spread
thou lifts thy unassuming head
in humble guise
but now the share uptears thy bed
and low thou lies

such is the fate of artless maid
sweet floweret of the rural shade
by love's simplicity betrayed
and guileless trust
till she, like thee, all soiled, is laid
low i' the dust

such is the fate of simple bard
on life's rough ocean luckless starr'd
unskilful he to note the card
of prudent lore
till billows rage, and gales blow hard
and whelm him o'er

such fate to suffering worth is given
who long with wants and woes has striven
by human pride or cunning driven
to misery's brink
till wrenched of every stay but heaven
he, ruined, sink

even thou who mourn'st the daisy's fate
that fate is thine--no distant date
stern ruin's plowshare drives, elate
full on thy bloom
till crushed beneath the furrow's weight
shall be thy doom



woman (not necessarily an old lady) _worthy of her years_. old age is
honourable if it carries a head that has a halo. (1807-92

up from the meadows rich with corn
clear in the cool september morn

the clustered spires of frederick stand
green-walled by the hills of maryland

roundabout them orchards sweep
apple and peach tree fruited deep

fair as the garden of the lord
to the eyes of the famished rebel horde

on that pleasant morn of the early fall
when lee marched over the mountain-wall

over the mountains winding down
horse and foot, into frederick town

forty flags with their silver stars
forty flags with their crimson bars

flapped in the morning wind: the sun
of noon looked down, and saw not one

up rose old barbara frietchie then
bowed with her fourscore years and ten

bravest of all in frederick town
she took up the flag the men hauled down

in her attic window the staff she set
to show that one heart was loyal yet

up the street came the rebel tread
stonewall jackson riding ahead

under his slouched hat left and right
he glanced: the old flag met his sight


it shivered the window, pane and sash
it rent the banner with seam and gash

quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
dame barbara snatched the silken scarf

she leaned far out on the window-sill
and shook it forth with a royal will

but spare your country's flag," she said

a shade of sadness, a blush of shame
over the face of the leader came

the nobler nature within him stirred
to life at that woman's deed and word

dies like a dog! march on!" he said

all day long through frederick street
sounded the tread of marching feet

all day long that free flag tost
over the heads of the rebel host

even its torn folds rose and fell
on the loyal winds that loved it well

and through the hill-gaps sunset light
shone over it with a warm good-night

barbara frietchie's work is o'er
and the rebel rides on his raids no more

honour to her! and let a tear
fall, for her sake, on stonewall's bier

over barbara frietchie's grave
flag of freedom and union, wave

peace and order and beauty draw
round thy symbol of light and law

and ever the stars above look down
on thy stars below in frederick town



the day's at the morn


and the second by campbell (1777-1844), are companions in sentiment and
equally popular with boys who love to win anything desirable by heroic
effort

oh, young lochinvar is come out of the west
through all the wide border his steed was the best
and save his good broadsword he weapons had none
he rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone
so faithful in love, and so dauntless in war
there never was knight like the young lochinvar

he stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for stone
he swam the eske river where ford there was none
but ere he alighted at netherby gate
the bride had consented, the gallant came late
for a laggard in love, and a dastard in war
was to wed the fair ellen of brave lochinvar

so boldly he entered the netherby hall
among bridesmen and kinsmen and brothers and all
then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword
or to dance at our bridal, young lord lochinvar

love swells like the solway, but ebbs like its tide
and now am i come, with this lost love of mine
to lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine
there are maidens in scotland more lovely by far
that would gladly be bride to the young lochinvar

the bride kissed the goblet; the knight took it up
he quaffed of the wine, and he threw down the cup
she looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh
with a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye
he took her soft hand ere her mother could bar

so stately his form, and so lovely her face
that never a hall such a galliard did grace
while her mother did fret, and her father did fume
and the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume
and the bridemaidens whispered, "'twere better by far
to have matched our fair cousin with young lochinvar

one touch to her hand, and one word in her ear
when they reached the hall door, and the charger stood near
so light to the croupe the fair lady he swung
so light to the saddle before her he sprung
they'll have fleet steeds that follow," quoth young lochinvar

there was mounting 'mong græmes of the netherby clan
forsters, fenwicks, and musgraves, they rode and they ran
there was racing and chasing, on cannobie lee
but the lost bride of netherby ne'er did they see
so daring in love, and so dauntless in war
have ye e'er heard of gallant like young lochinvar



a chieftain, to the highlands bound
cries, "boatman, do not tarry
and i'll give thee a silver pound
to row us o'er the ferry

this dark and stormy water
and this lord ullin's daughter

three days we've fled together
for should he find us in the glen
my blood would stain the heather

should they our steps discover
then who will cheer my bonny bride
when they have slain her lover

outspoke the hardy highland wight
it is not for your silver bright
but for your winsome lady

in danger shall not tarry
so though the waves are raging white
i'll row you o'er the ferry

by this the storm grew loud apace
the water-wraith was shrieking
and in the scowl of heaven each face
grew dark as they were speaking

but still as wilder blew the wind
and as the night grew drearer
adown the glen rode armèd men
their trampling sounded nearer

i'll meet the raging of the skies
but not an angry father

the boat has left a stormy land
a stormy sea before her
when, oh! too strong for human hand
the tempest gathered o'er her

and still they row'd amid the roar
of waters fast prevailing
lord ullin reach'd that fatal shore
his wrath was changed to wailing

for sore dismay'd through storm and shade
his child he did discover
one lovely hand she stretch'd for aid
and one was round her lover

and i'll forgive your highland chief
my daughter!--oh my daughter

return or aid preventing
the waters wild went o'er his child
and he was left lamenting



obedience under stern necessity. obedience is the salvation of any
army. john burroughs says: "i never hear that poem but what it thrills
me through and through

half a league, half a league
half a league onward
all in the valley of death
rode the six hundred
charge for the guns!" he said
into the valley of death
rode the six hundred

was there a man dismay'd
not tho' the soldier knew
some one had blunder'd
theirs not to make reply
theirs not to reason why
theirs but to do and die
into the valley of death
rode the six hundred

cannon to right of them
cannon to left of them
cannon in front of them
volley'd and thunder'd
storm'd at with shot and shell
boldly they rode and well
into the jaws of death
into the mouth of hell
rode the six hundred

flash'd all their sabers bare
flash'd as they turn'd in air
sab'ring the gunners there
charging an army, while
all the world wonder'd
plunged in the battery-smoke
right thro' the line they broke
cossack and russian
reel'd from the saber-stroke
shatter'd and sunder'd
then they rode back, but not
not the six hundred

cannon to right of them
cannon to left of them
cannon behind them
volleyed and thundered
stormed at with shot and shell
while horse and hero fell
they that had fought so well
came through the jaws of death
back from the mouth of hell
all that was left of them
left of six hundred

when can their glory fade
oh, the wild charge they made
all the world wondered
honour the charge they made
honour the light brigade
noble six hundred



there are several of sidney lanier's (1842-81) poems that children love
to learn. "tampa robins," "the tournament" (joust 1.), "barnacles
alabama" are among them. at our "poetry contests" the children have
plainly demonstrated that this great poet has reached his hand down to
the youngest. the time will doubtless come when it will be a part of
education to be acquainted with lanier, as it is now to be acquainted
with longfellow or tennyson


bright shone the lists, blue bent the skies
and the knights still hurried amain
to the tournament under the ladies' eyes
where the jousters were heart and brain


flourished the trumpets, entered heart
a youth in crimson and gold
flourished again; brain stood apart
steel-armoured, dark and cold


heart's palfrey caracoled gaily round
heart tra-li-ra'd merrily
but brain sat still, with never a sound
so cynical-calm was he


heart's helmet-crest bore favours three
from his lady's white hand caught
while brain wore a plumeless casque; not he
or favour gave or sought


the trumpet blew; heart shot a glance
to catch his lady's eye
but brain gazed straight ahead, his lance
to aim more faithfully


they charged, they struck; both fell, both bled
brain rose again, ungloved
heart, dying, smiled and faintly said



little laddie, do you remember learning "the wind and the moon"? you
were eight or nine years old, and you shut your eyes and puffed out
your cheeks when you came to the line "he blew and he blew." the saucy
wind made a great racket and the calm moon never noticed it. that gave
you a great deal of pleasure, didn't it? we did not care much for the
noisy, conceited wind. (1824

said the wind to the moon, "i will blow you out
you stare
in the air
like a ghost in a chair
always looking what i am about
i hate to be watched; i'll blow you out

the wind blew hard, and out went the moon
so, deep
on a heap
of clouds to sleep
down lay the wind, and slumbered soon
muttering low, "i've done for that moon

he turned in his bed; she was there again
on high
in the sky
with her one ghost eye
the moon shone white and alive and plain
said the wind, "i will blow you out again

the wind blew hard, and the moon grew dim
and my wedge
i have knocked off her edge
if only i blow right fierce and grim
the creature will soon be dimmer than dim

he blew and he blew, and she thinned to a thread
more's enough
to blow her to snuff
one good puff more where the last was bred
and glimmer, glimmer, glum will go the thread

he blew a great blast, and the thread was gone
in the air
nowhere
was a moonbeam bare
far off and harmless the shy stars shone
sure and certain the moon was gone

the wind he took to his revels once more
on down
in town
like a merry-mad clown
he leaped and hallooed with whistle and roar

he flew in a rage--he danced and blew
but in vain
was the pain
of his bursting brain
for still the broader the moon-scrap grew
the broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew

slowly she grew--till she filled the night
and shone
on her throne
in the sky alone
a matchless, wonderful silvery light
radiant and lovely, the queen of the night

with my breath
good faith
i blew her to death
first blew her away right out of the sky

but the moon she knew nothing about the affair
for high
in the sky
with her one white eye
motionless, miles above the air
she had never heard the great wind blare



favour of honest toil. (1848

joseph the carpenter--same trade as me
i thought as i'd find it--i knew it was here
but my sight's getting queer

i don't know right where as his shed must ha' stood
but often, as i've been a-planing my wood
i've took off my hat, just with thinking of he
at the same work as me

he warn't that set up that he couldn't stoop down
and work in the country for folks in the town
and i'll warrant he felt a bit pride, like i've done
at a good job begun

the parson he knows that i'll not make too free
but on sunday i feels as pleased as can be
when i wears my clean smock, and sits in a pew
and has taught a few

i think of as how not the parson hissen
as is teacher and father and shepherd o' men
not he knows as much of the lord in that shed
where he earned his own bread

and when i goes home to my missus, says she
for she knows my queer ways, and my love for the shed

so i comes right away by mysen, with the book
and i turns the old pages and has a good look
for the text as i've found, as tells me as he
were the same trade as me

why don't i mark it? ah, many say so
but i think i'd as lief, with your leaves, let it go
it do seem that nice when i fall on it sudden
unexpected, you know



covers all europe with her dainty hands and tresses while giving a kiss
to england, her own dear native land. (1808-79

when letty had scarce pass'd her third glad year
and her young, artless words began to flow
one day we gave the child a colour'd sphere
of the wide earth, that she might mark and know
by tint and outline, all its sea and land
she patted all the world; old empires peep'd
between her baby fingers; her soft hand
was welcome at all frontiers. how she leap'd
and laugh'd and prattled in her world-wide bliss
but when we turn'd her sweet unlearned eye
on our own isle, she rais'd a joyous cry
and, while she hid all england with a kiss
bright over europe fell her golden hair



once a dream did wave a shade
o'er my angel-guarded bed
that an emmet lost its way
when on grass methought i lay

troubled, 'wildered, and forlorn
dark, benighted, travel-worn
over many a tangled spray
all heart-broke, i heard her say

do they hear their father sigh
now they look abroad to see
now return and weep for me

pitying, i dropped a tear
but i saw a glow-worm near
who replied, "what wailing wight
calls the watchman of the night

while the beetle goes his round
follow now the beetle's hum
little wanderer, hie thee home




j.g. holland (1819-81) has immortalised himself in this line, at least

heaven is not reached at a single bound
but we build the ladder by which we rise
from the lowly earth to the vaulted skies
and we mount to its summit round by round

i count this thing to be grandly true
that a noble deed is a step toward god
lifting the soul from the common clod
to a purer air and a broader view



have you been to woodstock, near oxford, england? if so, you have seen
the palace of the duke of marlborough, who won the battle of blenheim
the main point of the poem is the doubtful honour in killing in our
great wars. southey, the poet, lived from 1774 to 1843

it was a summer's evening
old kaspar's work was done
and he before his cottage door
was sitting in the sun
and by him sported on the green
his little grandchild wilhelmine

she saw her brother peterkin
roll something large and round
which he, beside the rivulet
in playing there, had found
he came to ask what he had found
that was so large, and smooth, and round

old kaspar took it from the boy
who stood expectant by
and then the old man shook his head
and, with a natural sigh

for there's many hereabout
and often when i go to plow
the plowshare turns them out
for many thousand men," said he

young peterkin he cries
and little wilhelmine looks up
with wonder-waiting eyes
and what they killed each other for

but what they killed each other for
i could not well make out
but everybody said," quoth he

yon little stream hard by
they burned his dwelling to the ground
and he was forced to fly
so with his wife and child he fled
nor had he where to rest his head

was wasted far and wide
and many a childing mother then
and new-born baby died
but things like that, you know, must be
at every famous victory

after the field was won
for many thousand bodies here
lay rotting in the sun
but things like that, you know, must be
after a famous victory

respect to a boy of eleven years who liked the poem well enough to
recite it frequently. the scene is laid on helvellyn, to me the most
impressive mountain of the lake district of england. wordsworth is a
part of this country. i once heard john burroughs say: "i went to the
lake district to see what kind of a country it could be that would
produce a wordsworth

a barking sound the shepherd hears
a cry as of a dog or fox
he halts--and searches with his eyes
among the scattered rocks
and now at distance can discern
a stirring in a brake of fern
and instantly a dog is seen
glancing through that covert green

the dog is not of mountain breed
its motions, too, are wild and shy
with something, as the shepherd thinks
unusual in its cry
nor is there any one in sight
all round, in hollow or on height
nor shout, nor whistle strikes his ear
what is the creature doing here

it was a cove, a huge recess
that keeps, till june, december's snow
a lofty precipice in front
a silent tarn below
far in the bosom of helvellyn
remote from public road or dwelling
pathway, or cultivated land
from trace of human foot or hand

there sometimes doth a leaping fish
send through the tarn a lonely cheer
the crags repeat the raven's croak
in symphony austere
thither the rainbow comes--the cloud
and mists that spread the flying shroud
and sunbeams; and the sounding blast
that, if it could, would hurry past
but that enormous barrier binds it fast

not free from boding thoughts, a while
the shepherd stood: then makes his way
toward the dog, o'er rocks and stones
as quickly as he may
nor far had gone, before he found
a human skeleton on the ground
the appalled discoverer with a sigh
looks round, to learn the history

from those abrupt and perilous rocks
the man had fallen, that place of fear
at length upon the shepherd's mind
it breaks, and all is clear
he instantly recalled the name
and who he was, and whence he came
remembered, too, the very day
on which the traveller passed this way

but hear a wonder, for whose sake
this lamentable tale i tell
a lasting monument of words
this wonder merits well
the dog, which still was hovering nigh
repeating the same timid cry
this dog had been through three months space
a dweller in that savage place

yes, proof was plain that, since the day
when this ill-fated traveller died
the dog had watched about the spot
or by his master's side
how nourished here through such long time
he knows, who gave that love sublime
and gave that strength of feeling, great
above all human estimate



people are more and more coming to recognise the fact that each
individual soul has a right to its own stages of development. "the
chambered nautilus" is for that reason beloved of the masses. it is one
of the grandest poems ever written. "build thee more stately mansions
o my soul!" this line alone would make the poem immortal. (1809-94

this is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign
sailed the unshadowed main
the venturous bark that flings
on the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
in gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings
and coral reefs lie bare
where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair

its webs of living gauze no more unfurl
wrecked is the ship of pearl
and every chambered cell
where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell
as the frail tenant shaped his growing shell
before thee lies revealed
its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed

year after year beheld the silent toil
that spread his lustrous coil
still, as the spiral grew
he left the past year's dwelling for the new
stole with soft step its shining archway through
built up its idle door
stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more

thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee
child of the wandering sea
cast from her lap, forlorn
from thy dead lips a clearer note is born
than ever triton blew from wreathed horn
while on mine ear it rings
through the deep caves of thought i hear a voice that sings

build thee more stately mansions, o my soul
as the swift seasons roll
leave thy low-vaulted past
let each new temple, nobler than the last
shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast
till thou at length art free
leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea



tennyson's (1809-92) "crossing the bar" is one of the noblest
death-songs ever written. i include it in this volume out of respect to
a young philadelphia publisher who recited it one stormy night before
the passengers of a ship when i was crossing the atlantic, and also
because so many young people have the good taste to love it. it has
been said that next to browning's "prospice" it is the greatest
death-song ever written

sunset and evening star
and one clear call for me
and may there be no moaning of the bar
when i put out to sea

but such a tide as moving seems asleep
too full for sound and foam
when that which drew from out the boundless deep
turns again home

twilight and evening bell
and after that the dark
and may there be no sadness of farewell
when i embark

for tho' from out our bourne of time and place
the flood may bear me far
i hope to see my pilot face to face
when i have cross'd the bar



when one boy learns it the others want to follow. it takes as a hero
the man who gives common service--the one who does not lead or command
but follows the line of duty. (1865

in the name of the empress of india, make way
o lords of the jungle wherever you roam
the woods are astir at the close of the day
we exiles are waiting for letters from home
let the robber retreat; let the tiger turn tail
in the name of the empress the overland-mail

with a jingle of bells as the dusk gathers in
he turns to the foot-path that leads up the hill
the bags on his back, and a cloth round his chin
and, tucked in his belt, the post-office bill

is the torrent in spate? he must ford it or swim
has the rain wrecked the road? he must climb by the cliff
does the tempest cry "halt"? what are tempests to him
the service admits not a "but" or an "if
while the breath's in his mouth, he must bear without fail
in the name of the empress the overland-mail

from aloe to rose-oak, from rose-oak to fir
from level to upland, from upland to crest
from rice-field to rock-ridge, from rock-ridge to spur
fly the soft-sandalled feet, strains the brawny brown chest
from rail to ravine--to the peak from the vale
up, up through the night goes the overland-mail

there's a speck on the hillside, a dot on the road
a jingle of bells on the foot-path below
there's a scuffle above in the monkeys' abode
the world is awake, and the clouds are aglow
for the great sun himself must attend to the hail
in the name of the empress the overland-mail

true heart that wears one
come every steel blade, and
strong hand that bears one

leave nets and barges
come with your fighting gear
broadswords and targes

forests are rended
come as the waves come, when
navies are stranded
faster come, faster come
faster and faster

fast they come, fast they come
see how they gather
wide waves the eagle plume
blended with heather
cast your plaids, draw your blades
forward each man set

school-reader. boys and girls liked it then and they like it now. this
is another of the poems that was not born to die

at midnight, in his guarded tent
the turk was dreaming of the hour
when greece, her knee in suppliance bent
should tremble at his power
in dreams, through camp and court, he bore
the trophies of a conqueror
in dreams his song of triumph heard
then wore his monarch's signet ring
then pressed that monarch's throne--a king
as wild his thoughts, and gay of wing
as eden's garden bird

at midnight, in the forest shades
bozzaris ranged his suliote band
true as the steel of their tried blades
heroes in heart and hand
there had the persian's thousands stood
there had the glad earth drunk their blood
on old platæa's day
and now there breathed that haunted air
the sons of sires who conquered there
with arm to strike and soul to dare
as quick, as far as they

an hour passed on--the turk awoke
that bright dream was his last
he woke--to hear his sentries shriek
he woke--to die midst flame, and smoke
and shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke
and death-shots falling thick and fast
as lightnings from the mountain-cloud
and heard, with voice as trumpet loud
bozzaris cheer his band
strike--for your altars and your fires
strike--for the green graves of your sires
god--and your native land

they fought--like brave men, long and well
they piled that ground with moslem slain
they conquered--but bozzaris fell
bleeding at every vein
his few surviving comrades saw
his smile when rang their proud hurrah
and the red field was won
then saw in death his eyelids close
calmly, as to a night's repose
like flowers at set of sun

come to the bridal-chamber, death
come to the mother's, when she feels
for the first time, her first-born's breath
come when the blessed seals
that close the pestilence are broke
and crowded cities wail its stroke
come in consumption's ghastly form
the earthquake shock, the ocean storm
come when the heart beats high and warm
with banquet-song, and dance, and wine
and thou art terrible--the tear
the groan, the knell, the pall, the bier
and all we know, or dream, or fear
of agony, are thine

but to the hero, when his sword
has won the battle for the free
thy voice sounds like a prophet's word
and in its hollow tones are heard
the thanks of millions yet to be
come, when his task of fame is wrought
come, with her laurel-leaf, blood-bought
come in her crowning hour--and then
thy sunken eye's unearthly light
to him is welcome as the sight
of sky and stars to prisoned men
thy grasp is welcome as the hand
of brother in a foreign land
thy summons welcome as the cry
that told the indian isles were nigh
to the world-seeking genoese
when the land wind, from woods of palm
and orange-groves, and fields of balm
blew o'er the haytian seas

bozzaris! with the storied brave
greece nurtured in her glory's time
rest thee--there is no prouder grave
even in her own proud clime
she wore no funeral-weeds for thee
nor bade the dark hearse wave its plume
like torn branch from death's leafless tree
in sorrow's pomp and pageantry
the heartless luxury of the tomb
but she remembers thee as one
long loved and for a season gone
for thee her poet's lyre is wreathed
her marble wrought, her music breathed
for thee she rings the birthday bells
of thee her babe's first lisping tells
for thine her evening prayer is said
at palace-couch and cottage-bed
her soldier, closing with the foe
gives for thy sake a deadlier blow
his plighted maiden, when she fears
for him the joy of her young years
thinks of thy fate, and checks her tears
and she, the mother of thy boys
though in her eye and faded cheek
is read the grief she will not speak
the memory of her buried joys
and even she who gave thee birth
will, by their pilgrim-circled hearth
talk of thy doom without a sigh
for thou art freedom's now, and fame's
one of the few, the immortal names
that were not born to die



of the good old reader songs taught us by a teacher of good taste. we
love those teachers more the older we grow

wild was the night, yet a wilder night
hung round the soldier's pillow
in his bosom there waged a fiercer fight
than the fight on the wrathful billow

a few fond mourners were kneeling by
the few that his stern heart cherished
they knew, by his glazed and unearthly eye
that life had nearly perished

they knew by his awful and kingly look
by the order hastily spoken
that he dreamed of days when the nations shook
and the nations' hosts were broken

he dreamed that the frenchman's sword still slew
and triumphed the frenchman's eagle
and the struggling austrian fled anew
like the hare before the beagle

the bearded russian he scourged again
the prussian's camp was routed
and again on the hills of haughty spain
his mighty armies shouted

over egypt's sands, over alpine snows
at the pyramids, at the mountain
where the wave of the lordly danube flows
and by the italian fountain

on the snowy cliffs where mountain streams
dash by the switzer's dwelling
he led again, in his dying dreams
his hosts, the proud earth quelling

again marengo's field was won
and jena's bloody battle
again the world was overrun
made pale at his cannon's rattle

he died at the close of that darksome day
a day that shall live in story
in the rocky land they placed his clay



how sleep the brave, who sink to rest
by all their country's wishes blest
when spring, with dewy fingers cold
returns to deck their hallow'd mould
she there shall dress a sweeter sod
than fancy's feet have ever trod

by fairy hands their knell is rung
by forms unseen their dirge is sung
there honour comes, a pilgrim gray
to bless the turf that wraps their clay
and freedom shall a while repair
to dwell a weeping hermit there

along the street there comes
a blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums
a flash of colour beneath the sky
hats off
the flag is passing by

blue and crimson and white it shines
over the steel-tipped, ordered lines
hats off
the colours before us fly
but more than the flag is passing by

sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great
fought to make and to save the state
weary marches and sinking ships
cheers of victory on dying lips

days of plenty and years of peace
march of a strong land's swift increase

stately honour and reverend awe

sign of a nation, great and strong
toward her people from foreign wrong

on linden, when the sun was low
all bloodless lay th' untrodden snow
and dark as winter was the flow
of iser, rolling rapidly

but linden saw another sight
when the drum beat, at dead of night
commanding fires of death to light
the darkness of her scenery

by torch and trumpet fast array'd
each horseman drew his battle-blade
and furious every charger neigh'd
to join the dreadful revelry

then shook the hills with thunder riven
then rush'd the steed to battle driven
and louder than the bolts of heaven
far flashed the red artillery

but redder yet that light shall glow
on linden's hills or stainèd snow
and bloodier yet the torrent flow
of iser, rolling rapidly

can pierce the war-clouds, rolling dun
where furious frank, and fiery hun
shout in their sulphurous canopy

the combat deepens. on, ye brave
who rush to glory or the grave
wave, munich! all thy banners wave
and charge with all thy chivalry

few, few shall part, where many meet
the snow shall be their winding-sheet
and every turf beneath their feet
shall be a soldier's sepulcher



the sun shines bright in the old kentucky home
the corn-top's ripe, and the meadow's in the bloom
while the birds make music all the day
the young folks roll on the little cabin floor
all merry, all happy and bright
by-'n'-by hard times comes a-knocking at the door
then my old kentucky home, good-night

weep no more, my lady
o, weep no more to-day
we will sing one song for the old kentucky home
for the old kentucky home, far away

they hunt no more for the 'possum and the coon
on the meadow, the hill, and the shore
they sing no more by the glimmer of the moon
on the bench by the old cabin door
the day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart
with sorrow, where all was delight
the time has come when the darkeys have to part
then my old kentucky home, good-night

the head must bow, and the back will have to bend
wherever the darkey may go
a few more days, and the trouble all will end
in the field where the sugar-canes grow
a few more days for to tote the weary load
no matter, 'twill never be light
a few more days till we totter on the road
then my old kentucky home, good-night

weep no more, my lady
o, weep no more to-day
we will sing one song for the old kentucky home
for the old kentucky home, far away

far, far away
dere's wha my heart is turning ebber
dere's wha de old folks stay
all up and down de whole creation
sadly i roam
still longing for de old plantation
and for de old folks at home

all de world am sad and dreary
eberywhere i roam
oh, darkeys, how my heart grows weary
far from de old folks at home

all round de little farm i wandered
when i was young
den many happy days i squandered
many de songs i sung
when i was playing wid my brudder
oh, take me to my kind old mudder
dere let me live and die

one little hut among de bushes
one dat i love
still sadly to my memory rushes
no matter where i rove
when will i see de bees a-humming
all round de comb
when will i hear de banjo tumming
down in my good old home

all de world am sad and dreary
eberywhere i roam
oh, darkeys, how my heart grows weary
far from de old folks at home



woe," off the coast near cape ann, is a historic poem as well as an
imaginative composition

it was the schooner _hesperus
that sailed the wintry sea
and the skipper had taken his little daughter
to bear him company

blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax
her cheeks like the dawn of day
and her bosom white as the hawthorn buds
that ope in the month of may

the skipper he stood beside the helm
his pipe was in his mouth
and he watched how the veering flaw did blow
the smoke now west, now south

then up and spake an old sailor
had sailed the spanish main
for i fear a hurricane

and to-night no moon we see
the skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe
and a scornful laugh laughed he

colder and louder blew the wind
a gale from the northeast
the snow fell hissing in the brine
and the billows frothed like yeast

down came the storm, and smote amain
the vessel in its strength
she shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed
then leaped her cable's length

and do not tremble so
for i can weather the roughest gale
that ever wind did blow

he wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat
against the stinging blast
he cut a rope from a broken spar
and bound her to the mast

o say, what may it be
and he steered for the open sea

o say, what may it be
in such an angry sea

o say, what may it be
but the father answered never a word
a frozen corpse was he

lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark
with his face turned to the skies
the lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
on his fixed and glassy eyes

then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
that savèd she might be
and she thought of christ, who stilled the wave
on the lake of galilee

and fast through the midnight dark and drear
through the whistling sleet and snow
like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept
toward the reef of norman's woe

and ever the fitful gusts between
a sound came from the land
it was the sound of the trampling surf
on the rocks and the hard sea-sand

the breakers were right beneath her bows
she drifted a dreary wreck
and a whooping billow swept the crew
like icicles from her deck

she struck where the white and fleecy waves
looked soft as carded wool
but the cruel rocks they gored her side
like the horns of an angry bull

her rattling shrouds all sheathed in ice
with the masts went by the board
like a vessel of glass she stove and sank
ho! ho! the breakers roared

at daybreak on the bleak sea-beach
a fisherman stood aghast
to see the form of a maiden fair
lashed close to a drifting mast

the salt sea was frozen on her breast
the salt tears in her eyes
and he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed
on the billows fall and rise

such was the wreck of the _hesperus
in the midnight and the snow
christ save us all from a death like this
on the reef of norman's woe




you can look down on the battle-field of bannockburn from stirling
castle, scotland, near which stands a magnificent statue of robert, the
bruce. how often have i trodden over the old battle-field. the monument
of william wallace, too, looms up on the ochil hills, not far away

scots, wha hae wi' wallace bled
scots, wham bruce has aften led
welcome to your gory bed
or to victorie

now's the day, and now's the hour
see the front o' battle lower
see approach proud edward's power
chains and slaverie

wha will be a traitor knave
wha can fill a coward's grave
wha sae base as be a slave
let him turn and flee

wha for scotland's king and law
freedom's sword will strongly draw
freeman stand, or freeman fa
let him follow me

by oppression's woes and pains
by your sons in servile chains
we will drain our dearest veins
but they shall be free

lay the proud usurpers low
tyrants fall in every foe
liberty's in every blow
let us do, or die



lad and lassie



the man is wrecked and his ship is sunken before he ever steps on board
or sees the water if his heart is hard and his estimate of human beings
low. "the inchcape rock" is a thrust at hard-heartedness. "what is the
use of life?" to bear one another's burdens, to develop a genius for
pulling people through hard places--that's the use of life. it is the
last resort of a mean mind to crack jokes that wreck innocent voyagers
on life's sea. (1774-1843

no stir in the air, no stir in the sea
the ship was still as she could be
her sails from heaven received no motion
her keel was steady in the ocean

without either sign or sound of their shock
the waves flowed over the inchcape rock
so little they rose, so little they fell
they did not move the inchcape bell

the abbot of aberbrothok
had placed that bell on the inchcape rock
on a buoy in the storm it floated and swung
and over the waves its warning rung

when the rock was hid by the surge's swell
the mariners heard the warning bell
and then they knew the perilous rock
and blest the abbot of aberbrothok

the sun in heaven was shining gay
all things were joyful on that day
the sea-birds screamed as they wheeled round
and there was joyance in their sound

the buoy of the inchcape bell was seen
a dark spot on the ocean green
sir ralph the rover walked his deck
and he fixed his eye on the darker speck

he felt the cheering power of spring
it made him whistle, it made him sing
his heart was mirthful to excess
but the rover's mirth was wickedness

his eye was on the inchcape float
quoth he, "my men, put out the boat
and row me to the inchcape rock
and i'll plague the abbot of aberbrothok

the boat is lowered, the boatmen row
and to the inchcape rock they go
sir ralph bent over from the boat
and he cut the bell from the inchcape float

down sank the bell with a gurgling sound
the bubbles rose and burst around
quoth sir ralph, "the next who comes to the rock
won't bless the abbot of aberbrothok

sir ralph the rover sailed away
he scoured the sea for many a day
and now grown rich with plundered store
he steers his course for scotland's shore

so thick a haze o'erspread the sky
they cannot see the sun on high
the wind hath blown a gale all day
at evening it hath died away

on the deck the rover takes his stand
so dark it is they see no land
quoth sir ralph, "it will be brighter soon
for there is the dawn of the rising moon

for methinks we should be near the shore
but i wish i could hear the inchcape bell

they hear no sound; the swell is strong
though the wind hath fallen, they drift along
till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock

sir ralph the rover tore his hair
he curst himself in his despair
the waves rush in on every side
the ship is sinking beneath the tide

but, even in his dying fear
one dreadful sound could the rover hear
a sound as if with the inchcape bell
the devil below was ringing his knell



have learned it they know the meaning of every line and have caught the
spirit of the verse. there is an ancient "lyre," or violin, made in
northern africa, in the possession of a boston lady, and i have found
the mud-turtle rattle among the indians on the indian reservation at
syracuse, new york. they use it as a musical instrument in their
thanksgiving dances. the poem helps to build an interest in history and
mythology while it develops a child's reverence and insight. (1819-91

there lay upon the ocean's shore
what once a tortoise served to cover
a year and more, with rush and roar
the surf had rolled it over
had played with it, and flung it by
as wind and weather might decide it
then tossed it high where sand-drifts dry
cheap burial might provide it

it rested there to bleach or tan
the rains had soaked, the sun had burned it
with many a ban the fisherman
had stumbled o'er and spurned it
and there the fisher-girl would stay
conjecturing with her brother
how in their play the poor estray
might serve some use or other

so there it lay, through wet and dry
as empty as the last new sonnet
till by and by came mercury
and, having mused upon it
in shape, material, and dimension
give it but strings, and, lo, it sings
a wonderful invention

so said, so done; the chords he strained
and, as his fingers o'er them hovered
the shell disdained a soul had gained
the lyre had been discovered
o empty world that round us lies
dead shell, of soul and thought forsaken
brought we but eyes like mercury's
in thee what songs should waken



too, in stedman's collection. we all come to a point in life where we
need to burst the shell and fly away into the new realm. (1835-98

my little mädchen found one day
a curious something in her play
that was not fruit, nor flower, nor seed
it was not anything that grew
or crept, or climbed, or swam, or flew
had neither legs nor wings, indeed
and yet she was not sure, she said
whether it was alive or dead

she brought it in her tiny hand
to see if i would understand
and wondered when i made reply
with doubtful look she answered me
so then i told her what would be
some day within the chrysalis
how, slowly, in the dull brown thing
now still as death, a spotted wing
and then another, would unfold
till from the empty shell would fly
a pretty creature, by and by
all radiant in blue and gold

her laughing lips and eager eyes
all in a sparkle of surprise
that ere the worm within its shell
its gauzy, splendid wings had spread
my little mädchen would be dead

to-day the butterfly has flown
she was not here to see it fly
and sorrowing i wonder why
the empty shell is mine alone
perhaps the secret lies in this
i too had found a chrysalis
and death that robbed me of delight
was but the radiant creature's flight



robert burns, the plowman and poet, "dinnered wi' a lord." the story
goes that he was put at the second table. that lord is dead, but robert
burns still lives. he is immortal. it is "the survival of the fittest

in education than good penmanship or good spelling. (1759-96

young father over his new baby. if girls should be educated to be good
mothers, so should boys be taught that fatherhood is the highest and
holiest joy and right of man. the child is educator to the man. he
teaches him how to take responsibility, how to give unbiased judgments
and how to be fatherly like "our father who is in heaven." (1844

there came to port last sunday night
the queerest little craft
without an inch of rigging on
i looked and looked and laughed
it seemed so curious that she
should cross the unknown water
and moor herself right in my room
my daughter, o my daughter

yet by these presents witness all
she's welcome fifty times
and comes consigned to hope and love
and common-meter rhymes
she has no manifest but this
no flag floats o'er the water
she's too new for the british lloyds
my daughter, o my daughter

ring out, wild bells, and tame ones too
ring out the lover's moon
ring in the little worsted socks
ring in the bib and spoon
ring out the muse! ring in the nurse
ring in the milk and water
away with paper, pen, and ink
my daughter, o my daughter



tennyson's "the brook" is included out of love to a dear old schoolmate
in colorado. the real brook, near cambridge, england, is tame compared
to your colorado streams, o beloved comrade. this poem is well liked by
the majority of pupils. (1809-92

i chatter, chatter, as i flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever

i wind about, and in and out
with here a blossom sailing
and here and there a lusty trout
and here and there a grayling

i steal by lawns and grassy plots
i slide by hazel covers
i move the sweet forget-me-nots
that grow for happy lovers

i slip, i slide, i gloom, i glance
among my skimming swallows
i make the netted sunbeams dance
against my sandy shallows

i murmur under moon and stars
in brambly wildernesses
i linger by my shingly bars
i loiter round my cresses

and out again i curve and flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever

and few boys will hold out to the end in learning it. but "it pays

it was our war-ship _clampherdown
would sweep the channel clean
wherefore she kept her hatches close
when the merry channel chops arose
to save the bleached marine

she had one bow-gun of a hundred ton
and a great stern-gun beside
they dipped their noses deep in the sea
they racked their stays and stanchions free
in the wash of the wind-whipped tide

it was our war-ship _clampherdown
fell in with a cruiser light
that carried the dainty hotchkiss gun
and a pair o' heels wherewith to run
from the grip of a close-fought fight

she opened fire at seven miles
as ye shoot at a bobbing cork
and once she fired and twice she fired
till the bow-gun drooped like a lily tired
that lolls upon the stalk

the deck-beams break below
and botch the shattered plates again
and he answered, "make it so

she opened fire within the mile
as ye shoot at the flying duck
and the great stern-gun shot fair and true
with the heave of the ship, to the stainless blue
and the great stern-turret stuck

the feed-pipes burst below
you can hear the hiss of helpless ram
you can hear the twisted runners jam
and he answered, "turn and go

it was our war-ship _clampherdown
and grimly did she roll
swung round to take the cruiser's fire
as the white whale faces the thresher's ire
when they war by the frozen pole

and faster still fall we
and it is not meet for english stock
to bide in the heart of an eight-day clock
the death they cannot see

we drift upon her beam
we dare not ram, for she can run
and dare ye fire another gun
and die in the peeling steam

it was our war-ship _clampherdown
that carried an armour-belt
but fifty feet at stern and bow
lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow
to the hail of the nordenfeldt

the chilled steel bolts are swift
we have emptied the bunkers in open sea
their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be
and he answered, "let her drift

it was our war-ship _clampherdown
swung round upon the tide
her two dumb guns glared south and north
and the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth
and she ground the cruiser's side

they bid you send your sword
and he answered, "grapple her stern and bow
they have asked for the steel. they shall have it now
out cutlasses and board

it was our war-ship _clampherdown
spewed up four hundred men
and the scalded stokers yelped delight
as they rolled in the waist and heard the fight
stamp o'er their steel-walled pen

they cleared the cruiser end to end
from conning-tower to hold
they fought as they fought in nelson's fleet
they were stripped to the waist, they were bare to the feet
as it was in the days of old

it was the sinking _clampherdown
heaved up her battered side
and carried a million pounds in steel
to the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel
and the scour of the channel tide

it was the crew of the _clampherdown
stood out to sweep the sea
on a cruiser won from an ancient foe
as it was in the days of long-ago
and as it still shall be



collection because johnnie, a ten-year-old, and many of his friends
say, "it's great." (1788-1824

the assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold
and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold
and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea
when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee

like the leaves of the forest when the summer is green
that host with their banners at sunset were seen
like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown
that host on the morrow lay withered and strown

for the angel of death spread his wings on the blast
and breathed in the face of the foe as he passed
and the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill
and their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still

and there lay the steed with his nostril all wide
but through it there rolled not the breath of his pride
and the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf
and cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf

and there lay the rider distorted and pale
with the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail
and the tents were all silent, the banners alone
the lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown

and the widows of ashur are loud in their wail
and the idols are broke in the temple of baal
and the might of the gentile, unsmote by the sword
hath melted like snow in the glance of the lord



i remember, i remember
the house where i was born
the little window where the sun
came peeping in at morn
he never came a wink too soon
nor brought too long a day
but now, i often wish the night
had borne my breath away

i remember, i remember
the roses, red and white
the violets, and the lily-cups
those flowers made of light
the lilacs where the robin built
and where my brother set
the laburnum on his birthday
the tree is living yet

i remember, i remember
where i was used to swing
and thought the air must rush as fresh
to swallows on the wing
my spirit flew in feathers then
that is so heavy now
and summer pools could hardly cool
the fever on my brow

i remember, i remember
the fir trees dark and high
i used to think their slender tops
were close against the sky
it was a childish ignorance
but now 'tis little joy
to know i'm farther off from heaven
than when i was a boy



out of the clover and blue-eyed grass
he turned them into the river lane
one after another he let them pass
then fastened the meadow bars again

under the willows and over the hill
he patiently followed their sober pace
the merry whistle for once was still
and something shadowed the sunny face

only a boy! and his father had said
he never could let his youngest go
two already were lying dead
under the feet of the trampling foe

but after the evening work was done
and the frogs were loud in the meadow-swamp
over his shoulder he slung his gun
and stealthily followed the footpath damp

across the clover, and through the wheat
with resolute heart and purpose grim
though the dew was on his hurrying feet
and the blind bat's flitting startled him

thrice since then had the lanes been white
and the orchards sweet with apple-bloom
and now, when the cows came back at night
the feeble father drove them home

for news had come to the lonely farm
that three were lying where two had lain
and the old man's tremulous, palsied arm
could never lean on a son's again

the summer day grew cool and late
he went for the cows when the work was done
but down the lane, as he opened the gate
he saw them coming one by one

brindle, ebony, speckle, and bess
shaking their horns in the evening wind
cropping the buttercups out of the grass
but who was it following close behind

loosely swung in the idle air
the empty sleeve of army blue
and worn and pale, from the crisping hair
looked out a face that the father knew

for close-barred prisons will sometimes yawn
and yield their dead unto life again
and the day that comes with a cloudy dawn
in golden glory at last may wane

the great tears sprang to their meeting eyes
for the heart must speak when the lips are dumb
and under the silent evening skies
together they followed the cattle home




it was summer when he smiled

eugene field, above all other poets, paid the finest tribute to
children. this poet only, could make the whole ocean warm because a
child's heart was there to warm it

krinken was a little child
it was summer when he smiled
oft the hoary sea and grim
stretched its white arms out to him
calling, "sun-child, come to me
let me warm my heart with thee
but the child heard not the sea
calling, yearning evermore
for the summer on the shore

krinken on the beach one day
saw a maiden nis at play
on the pebbly beach she played
in the summer krinken made
fair, and very fair, was she
just a little child was he
just a kiss, and go with me
to the summer-lands that be
down within the silver sea

krinken was a little child
by the maiden nis beguiled
hand in hand with her went he
and 'twas summer in the sea
and the hoary sea and grim
to its bosom folded him
clasped and kissed the little form
and the ocean's heart was warm

now the sea calls out no more
it is winter on the shore
winter where that little child
made sweet summer when he smiled
though 'tis summer on the sea
where with maiden nis went he
it is winter on the shore
winter, winter evermore

of the summer on the deep
come sweet visions in my sleep
these my dreams of summer be

krinken was a little child
by the maiden nis beguiled
oft the hoary sea and grim
reached its longing arms to him
crying, "sim-child, come to me
let me warm my heart with thee
but the sea calls out no more
it is winter on the shore
winter, cold and dark and wild

krinken was a little child
it was summer when he smiled
down he went into the sea
and the winter bides with me
just a little child was he



she spoke to stevenson--the master smiled
too swift they come, and all too swiftly fly

so by a formal deed he there conveyed
all right and title in his natal day
to have and hold, to sell or give away
then signed, and gave it to the little maid

joyful, yet fearing to believe too much
she took the deed, but scarcely dared unfold
ah, liberal genius! at whose potent touch
all common things shine with transmuted gold
a day of stevenson's will prove to be
not part of time, but immortality



i learned "a modest wit" as a reading-lesson when i was a child. it has
clung to me and so i cling to it. it is just as good as it ever was. it
is a sharp thrust at power that depends on externalities. selleck
osborne

a supercilious nabob of the east
haughty, being great--purse-proud, being rich
a governor, or general, at the least
i have forgotten which
had in his family a humble youth
who went from england in his patron's suit
an unassuming boy, in truth
a lad of decent parts, and good repute

this youth had sense and spirit
but yet with all his sense
excessive diffidence
obscured his merit

one day, at table, flushed with pride and wine
his honour, proudly free, severely merry
conceived it would be vastly fine
to crack a joke upon his secretary

did your good father gain a livelihood

instead of teaching you to sew
pray, why did not your father make
a saddler, sir, of you

each parasite, then, as in duty bound
the joke applauded, and the laugh went round
at length modestus, bowing low
said (craving pardon, if too free he made
your father's trade

my father's trade? why, blockhead, are you mad
my father, sir, did never stoop so low
he was a gentleman, i'd have you know

modestus said, with archness on his brow
a gentleman of you



1774-1843). but "the mouse-tower on the rhine" is an object of interest
to travellers, and the story has a point

the summer and autumn had been so wet
that in winter the corn was growing yet
the grain lie rotting on the ground

every day the starving poor
crowded around bishop hatto's door
for he had a plentiful last-year's store
and all the neighbourhood could tell
his granaries were furnished well

at last bishop hatto appointed a day
to quiet the poor without delay
he bade them to his great barn repair
and they should have food for winter there

rejoiced such tidings good to hear
the poor folk flocked from far and near
the great barn was full as it could hold
of women and children, and young and old

then, when he saw it could hold no more
bishop hatto, he made fast the door
and while for mercy on christ they call
he set fire to the barn and burned them all

for ridding it in these times forlorn
of rats that only consume the corn

so then to his palace returnèd he
and he sat down to supper merrily
and he slept that night like an innocent man
but bishop hatto never slept again

in the morning as he entered the hall
where his picture hung against the wall
a sweat-like death all over him came
for the rats had eaten it out of the frame

as he looked, there came a man from his farm
he had a countenance white with alarm
and the rats had eaten all your corn

another came running presently
and he was pale as pale could be
the lord forgive you yesterday

the walls are high, and the shores are steep
and the stream is strong, and the water deep

bishop hatto fearfully hastened away
and he crossed the rhine without delay
and reached his tower, and barred with care
all windows, doors, and loop-holes there

he laid him down, and closed his eyes
but soon a scream made him arise
he started and saw two eyes of flame
on his pillow, from whence the screaming came

he listened and looked; it was only the cat
but the bishop he grew more fearful for that
for she sat screaming, mad with fear
at the army of rats that was drawing near

for they have swum over the river so deep
and they have climbed the shore so steep
and up the tower their way is bent
to do the work for which they were sent

they are not to be told by the dozen or score
by thousands they come, and by myriads and more
such numbers had never been heard of before
such a judgment had never been witnessed of yore

down on his knees the bishop fell
and faster and faster his beads did tell
as, louder and louder drawing near
the gnawing of their teeth he could hear

and in at the windows and in at the door
and through the walls, helter-skelter they pour
and down from the ceiling and up through the floor
from the right and the left, from behind and before
and all at once to the bishop they go

they have whetted their teeth against the stones
and now they pick the bishop's bones
they gnawed the flesh from every limb
for they were sent to do judgment on him



we are greatly indebted to joaquin miller for his "sail on! sail on
endurance is the watchword of the poem and the watchword of our
republic. every man to his gun! columbus discovered america in his own
mind before he realised it or proved its existence. i have often drawn
a chart of columbus's life and voyages to show what need he had of the
motto "sail on!" to accomplish his end. this is one of our greatest
american poems. the writer still lives in california

behind him lay the gray azores
behind the gates of hercules
before him not the ghost of shores
before him only shoreless seas
the good mate said: "now must we pray
for lo! the very stars are gone
speak, admiral, what shall i say

my men grow ghastly wan and weak
the stout mate thought of home; a spray
of salt wave wash'd his swarthy cheek
if we sight naught but seas at dawn

they sailed and sailed, as winds might blow
until at last the blanch'd mate said
should i and all my men fall dead
these very winds forget their way
for god from these dread seas is gone
now speak, brave admiral, and say
he said: "sail on! and on

they sailed, they sailed, then spoke his mate
he curls his lip, he lies in wait
with lifted teeth as if to bite
brave admiral, say but one word
what shall we do when hope is gone
the words leaped as a leaping sword

then, pale and worn, he kept his deck
and thro' the darkness peered that night
ah, darkest night! and then a speck
a light! a light! a light! a light
it grew--a star-lit flag unfurled
it grew to be time's burst of dawn
he gained a world! he gave that world
its watch-word: "on! and on



once a year the children learn "the shepherd of king admetus," which is
one of the finest poems ever written as showing the possible growth of
real history into mythology, the tendency of mankind to deify what is
fine or sublime in human action. not every child will learn this entire
poem, because it is too long. but every child will learn the best lines
in it while the children are teaching it to me and when i take my turn
in teaching it to them. no child fails to catch the spirit and intent
of the poem and to become entirely familiar with it. (1819-91

there came a youth upon the earth
some thousand years ago
whose slender hands were nothing worth
whether to plow, or reap, or sow

upon an empty tortoise-shell
he stretched some chords, and drew
music that made men's bosoms swell
fearless, or brimmed their eyes with dew

then king admetus, one who had
pure taste by right divine
decreed his singing not too bad
to hear between the cups of wine

and so, well pleased with being soothed
into a sweet half-sleep
three times his kingly beard he smoothed
and made him viceroy o'er his sheep

his words were simple words enough
and yet he used them so
that what in other mouths was rough
in his seemed musical and low

men called him but a shiftless youth
in whom no good they saw
and yet, unwittingly, in truth
they made his careless words their law

they knew not how he learned at all
for idly, hour by hour
he sat and watched the dead leaves fall
or mused upon a common flower

it seemed the loveliness of things
did teach him all their use
for, in mere weeds, and stones, and springs
he found a healing power profuse

men granted that his speech was wise
but, when a glance they caught
of his slim grace and woman's eyes
they laughed, and called him good-for-naught

yet after he was dead and gone
and e'en his memory dim
earth seemed more sweet to live upon
more full of love, because of him

and day by day more holy grew
each spot where he had trod
till after-poets only knew
their first-born brother as a god



i have an old essay written by a lad of fourteen years on "how they
brought the good news from ghent to aix." i should judge from this
essay that any boy at that age would like the poem, even if he had not
himself been over the ground as this boy had. (1812-89

i sprang to the stirrup, and joris, and he
i galloped, dirck galloped, we galloped all three
behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest
and into the midnight we galloped abreast

not a word to each other; we kept the great pace
neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place
i turned in my saddle and made its girth tight
then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right
rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit
nor galloped less steadily roland a whit

lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear
at boom, a great yellow star came out to see
at düffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be
and from mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime
so joris broke silence with, "yet there is time

at aershot, up leaped of a sudden the sun
and against him the cattle stood black every one
to stare through the mist at us galloping past
and i saw my stout galloper roland at last
with resolute shoulders, each butting away
the haze, as some bluff river headland its spray

and his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
for my voice, and the other pricked out on his track
and one eye's black intelligence,--ever that glance
o'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance
and the thick, heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon
his fierce lips shook upward in galloping on

by hasselt, dirck groaned; and cried joris, "stay spur
your roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her
we'll remember at aix"--for one heard the quick wheeze
of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees
and sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank
as down on her haunches she shuddered and sank

past looz and past tongres, no cloud in the sky
the broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh
till over by dalhem a dome-spire sprang white
and "gallop," gasped joris, "for aix is in sight

rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone
and there was my roland to bear the whole weight
of the news which alone could save aix from her fate
with his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim
and with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim

then i cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall
shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all
stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear
called my roland his pet-name, my horse without peer
clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good
till at length into aix roland galloped and stood

and all i remember is--friends flocking round
as i sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground
and no voice but was praising this roland of mine
as i poured down his throat our last measure of wine
which (the burgesses voting by common consent
was no more than his due who brought the good news from ghent



a child. a distinguished teacher says: "it has become a part of popular
education," as has also "the eve of waterloo" and "the death of
napoleon." they are all poems of great rhythmical swing, intense and
graphic. (1791-1823

not a drum was heard, not a funeral note
as his corse to the rampart we hurried
not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
o'er the grave where our hero we buried

we buried him darkly at dead of night
the sods with our bayonets turning
by the struggling moonbeam's misty light
and the lantern dimly burning

no useless coffin enclosed his breast
not in sheet nor in shroud we wound him
but he lay like a warrior taking his rest
with his martial cloak around him

few and short were the prayers we said
and we spoke not a word of sorrow
but we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead
and we bitterly thought of the morrow

we thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed
and smoothed down his lonely pillow
that the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head
and we far away on the billow

lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone
and o'er his cold ashes upbraid him
but little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on
in the grave where a briton has laid him

but half of our heavy task was done
when the clock struck the hour for retiring
and we heard the distant and random gun
that the foe was sullenly firing

slowly and sadly we laid him down
from the field of his fame fresh and gory
we carved not a line, and we raised not a stone
but we left him alone with his glory



reading-book gem that will always be dear to every boy's heart if he
only reads it a few times

there was a sound of revelry by night
and belgium's capital had gathered then
her beauty and her chivalry, and bright
the lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men
a thousand hearts beat happily; and when
music arose with its voluptuous swell
soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again
and all went merry as a marriage-bell
but hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell

did ye not hear it? no; 'twas but the wind
or the car rattling o'er the stony street
on with the dance! let joy be unconfined
no sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet
to chase the glowing hours with flying feet
but hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more
as if the clouds its echo would repeat
and nearer, clearer, deadlier, than before
arm! arm! it is--it is the cannon's opening roar

ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro
and gathering tears, and tremblings of distress
and cheeks all pale, which, but an hour ago
blushed at the praise of their own loveliness
and there were sudden partings, such as press
the life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
which ne'er might be repeated: who could guess
if ever more should meet those mutual eyes
since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise

and there was mounting in hot haste: the steed
the mustering squadron, and the clattering car
went pouring forward with impetuous speed
and swiftly forming in the ranks of war
and the deep thunder peal on peal afar
and near, the beat of the alarming drum
roused up the soldier ere the morning star
while thronged the citizens with terror dumb
or whispering with white lips, "the foe! they come! they come

and ardennes waves above them her green leaves
dewy with nature's tear-drops, as they pass
grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves
over the unreturning brave--alas
ere evening to be trodden like the grass
which, now beneath them, but above shall grow
in its next verdure, when this fiery mass
of living valour, rolling on the foe
and burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low

last noon beheld them full of lusty life
last eve in beauty's circle proudly gay
the midnight brought the signal-sound of strife
the morn the marshalling in arms,--the day
battle's magnificently stern array
the thunder-clouds close o'er it, which, when rent
the earth is covered thick with other clay
which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent
rider, and horse--friend, foe--in one red burial blent




laddie, aged eleven, do you remember how you studied and recited "king
henry of navarre" every poetry hour for a year? it was a long poem, but
you stuck to it to the end. we did not know the meaning of a certain
word, but i found it up in switzerland. it is the name of a little
town. (1800-59

now glory to the lord of hosts, from whom all glories are
and glory to our sovereign liege, king henry of navarre

now let there be the merry sound of music and of dance
through thy corn-fields green, and sunny vines, o pleasant
land of france
and thou, rochelle, our own rochelle, proud city of the waters
again let rapture light the eyes of all thy mourning daughters
as thou wert constant in our ills, be joyous in our joy
for cold, and stiff, and still are they who wrought thy walls annoy
hurrah! hurrah! a single field hath turned the chance of war
hurrah! hurrah! for ivry, and henry of navarre

oh! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of day
we saw the army of the league drawn out in long array
with all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers
and appenzel's stout infantry, and egmont's flemish spears
there rode the brood of false lorraine, the curses of our land
and dark mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand
and, as we looked on them, we thought of seine's empurpled flood
and good coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood
and we cried unto the living god, who rules the fate of war
to fight for his own holy name, and henry of navarre

the king is come to marshal us, in all his armour drest
and he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest
he looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye
he looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high
right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing
down all our line, a deafening shout, "god save our lord the king
for never saw i promise yet of such a bloody fray
press where ye see my white plume shine, amid the ranks of war
and be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of navarre

hurrah! the foes are moving. hark to the mingled din
of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin
the fiery duke is pricking fast across st. andré's plain
with all the hireling chivalry of guelders and almayne
now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of france
charge for the golden lilies,--upon them with the lance
a thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest
a thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest
and in they burst, and on they rushed, while like a guiding star
amid the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of navarre

now, god be praised, the day is ours. mayenne hath turned his rein
d'aumale hath cried for quarter. the flemish count is slain
their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a biscay gale
the field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail
and then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van
but out spake gentle henry, "no frenchman is my foe
down, down with every foreigner, but let your brethren go
oh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war
as our sovereign lord, king henry, the soldier of navarre

right well fought all the frenchmen who fought for france to-day
and many a lordly banner god gave them for a prey
but we of the religion have borne us best in fight
and the good lord of rosny has ta'en the cornet white
our own true maximilian the cornet white hath ta'en
the cornet white with crosses black, the flag of false lorraine
up with it high; unfurl it wide; that all the host may know
how god hath humbled the proud house which wrought his church such woe
then on the ground, while trumpets sound their loudest points of war
fling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for henry of navarre

ho! maidens of vienna; ho! matrons of lucerne
weep, weep, and rend your hair for those who never shall return
ho! philip, send, for charity, thy mexican pistoles
that antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearman's souls
ho! gallant nobles of the league, look that your arms be bright
ho! burghers of saint genevieve, keep watch and ward to-night
for our god hath crushed the tyrant, our god hath raised the slave
and mocked the counsel of the wise, the valour of the brave
then glory to his holy name, from whom all glories are
and glory to our sovereign lord, king henry of navarre



incisive thrust at the vanity of "fair" women. a woman be a "true
knight" as well as a man. leigh hunt (1784-1859

king francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport
and one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the court
the nobles filled the benches, with the ladies in their pride
and 'mong them sat the count de lorge with one for whom he sighed
and truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show
valour, and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below

ramp'd and roar'd the lions, with horrid laughing jaws
they bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind
went with their paws
with wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another
till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother
the bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air
said francis then, "faith, gentlemen, we're better here than there

de lorge's love o'erheard the king,--a beauteous lively dame
with smiling lips and sharp, bright eyes, which always seem'd the same
she thought, "the count, my lover, is brave as brave can be
he surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me
king, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine
i'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine

she dropped her glove, to prove his love, then look'd
at him and smiled
he bowed, and in a moment leapt among the lions wild
his leap was quick, return was quick, he has regain'd his place
then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's face
from where he sat



i found the well of st. keyne in cornwall, england--not the poem, but
the real well. the poem is of the great body of world-lore. southey

a well there is in the west country
and a clearer one never was seen
there is not a wife in the west-country
but has heard of the well of st. keyne

an oak and an elm tree stand beside
and behind does an ash tree grow
and a willow from the bank above
droops to the water below

a traveller came to the well of st. keyne
pleasant it was to his eye
for from cock-crow he had been travelling
and there was not a cloud in the sky

he drank of the water so cool and clear
for thirsty and hot was he
and he sat down upon the bank
under the willow tree

there came a man from the neighbouring town
at the well to fill his pail
on the well-side he rested it
and bade the stranger hail

the happiest draught thou hast drunk this day
that ever thou didst in thy life

in cornwall ever been
for an if she have, i'll venture my life
she has drunk of the well of st. keyne

the stranger he made reply
i pray you answer me why

drank of this crystal well
and before the angel summoned her
she laid on the water a spell

shall drink before his wife
a happy man thenceforth is he
for he shall be master for life

god help the husband then
the stranger stoop'd to the well of st. keyne
and drank of the waters again

he to the countryman said
but the countryman smiled as the stranger spake
and sheepishly shook his head

and left my wife in the porch
but i' faith she had been wiser than me
for she took a bottle to church



twelve-year-old girl who recited it at one of our poetry hours years
never read it without feeling that it stands test. anonymous

the nautilus and the ammonite
were launched in friendly strife
each sent to float in its tiny boat
on the wide, wide sea of life

for each could swim on the ocean's brim
and, when wearied, its sail could furl
and sink to sleep in the great sea-deep
in its palace all of pearl

and theirs was a bliss more fair than this
which we taste in our colder clime
for they were rife in a tropic life
a brighter and better clime

they swam 'mid isles whose summer smiles
were dimmed by no alloy
whose groves were palm, whose air was balm
and life one only joy

they sailed all day through creek and bay
and traversed the ocean deep
and at night they sank on a coral bank
in its fairy bowers to sleep

and the monsters vast of ages past
they beheld in their ocean caves
they saw them ride in their power and pride
and sink in their deep-sea graves

and hand in hand, from strand to strand
they sailed in mirth and glee
these fairy shells, with their crystal cells
twin sisters of the sea

and they came at last to a sea long past
but as they reached its shore
the almighty's breath spoke out in death
and the ammonite was no more

so the nautilus now in its shelly prow
as over the deep it strays
still seems to seek, in bay and creek
its companion of other days

and alike do we, on life's stormy sea
as we roam from shore to shore
thus tempest-tossed, seek the loved, the lost
and find them on earth no more

yet the hope how sweet, again to meet
as we look to a distant strand
where heart meets heart, and no more they part
who meet in that better land



i am monarch of all i survey
my right there is none to dispute
from the center all round to the sea
i am lord of the fowl and the brute
o solitude! where are the charms
that sages have seen in thy face
better dwell in the midst of alarms
than reign in this horrible place

i am out of humanity's reach
i must finish my journey alone
never hear the sweet music of speech
i start at the sound of my own
the beasts that roam over the plain
my form with indifference see
they are so unacquainted with man
their tameness is shocking to me

society, friendship, and love
divinely bestow'd upon man
oh, had i the wings of a dove
how soon would i taste you again
my sorrows i then might assuage
in the ways of religion and truth
might learn from the wisdom of age
and be cheer'd by the sallies of youth

ye winds that have made me your sport
convey to this desolate shore
some cordial endearing report
of a land i shall visit no more

my friends--do they now and then send
a wish or a thought after me
oh, tell me i yet have a friend
though a friend i am never to see

how fleet is a glance of the mind
compared with the speed of its flight
the tempest itself lags behind
and the swift-wingèd arrows of light
when i think of my own native land
in a moment i seem to be there
but alas! recollection at hand
soon hurries me back to despair

but the seafowl is gone to her nest
the beast is laid down in his lair
even here is a season of rest
and i to my cabin repair
there's mercy in every place
and mercy, encouraging thought
gives even affliction a grace
and reconciles man to his lot



i wonder if the english people appreciate "the homes of england." it is
a stately poem worthy of a goethe or a shakespeare. england is
distinctively a country of homes, pretty, little, humble homes as well
as stately palaces and castles, homes well made of stone or brick for
the most part, and clad with ivy and roses. who would not be proud to
have had such a home as ann hathaway's humble cottage or one of the
little huts in the lake district? the homes of america are often more
palatial, especially in small cities, but the use of wood in america
makes them less substantial than the slate-and-brick houses of england

the stately homes of england
how beautiful they stand
amidst their tall ancestral trees
o'er all the pleasant land
the deer across their greensward bound
through shade and sunny gleam
and the swan glides past them with the sound
of some rejoicing stream

the merry homes of england
around their hearths by night
what gladsome looks of household love
meet in the ruddy light
there woman's voice flows forth in song
or childish tale is told
or lips move tunefully along
some glorious page of old

the blessèd homes of england
how softly on their bowers
is laid the holy quietness
that breathes from sabbath hours
solemn, yet sweet, the church-bell's chime
floats through their woods at morn
all other sounds, in that still time
of breeze and leaf are born

the cottage homes of england
by thousands on her plains
they are smiling o'er the silvery brooks
and round the hamlets' fanes
through glowing orchards forth they peep
each from its nook of leaves
and fearless there the lowly sleep
as the bird beneath their eaves

the free, fair homes of england
long, long, in hut and hall
may hearts of native proof be reared
to guard each hallowed wall
and green forever be the groves
and bright the flowery sod
where first the child's glad spirit loves
its country and its god



but i never saw a boy who did not want some stanzas of it. "hold the
bridge with me!" boys like that motto instinctively. t.b. macaulay

lars porsena of clusium
by the nine gods he swore
that the great house of tarquin
should suffer wrong no more
by the nine gods he swore it
and named a trysting-day
and bade his messengers ride forth
east and west and south and north
to summon his array

east and west and south and north
the messengers ride fast
and tower and town and cottage
have heard the trumpet's blast
shame on the false etruscan
who lingers in his home
when porsena of clusium
is on the march for rome

the horsemen and the footmen
are pouring in amain
from many a stately market-place
from many a fruitful plain
from many a lonely hamlet
which, hid by beech and pine
like an eagle's nest, hangs on the crest
of purple apennine

the harvests of arretium
this year, old men shall reap
this year, young boys in umbro
shall plunge the struggling sheep
and in the vats of luna
this year, the must shall foam
round the white feet of laughing girls
whose sires have marched to rome

there be thirty chosen prophets
the wisest of the land
who alway by lars porsena
both morn and evening stand
evening and morn the thirty
have turned the verses o'er
traced from the right on linen white
by mighty seers of yore

and with one voice the thirty
have their glad answer given
go forth, beloved of heaven
go, and return in glory
to clusium's royal dome
and hang round nurscia's altars
the golden shields of rome

and now hath every city
sent up her tale of men
the foot are fourscore thousand
the horse are thousands ten
before the gates of sutrium
is met the great array
a proud man was lars porsena
upon the trysting-day

for all the etruscan armies
were ranged beneath his eye
and many a banished roman
and many a stout ally
and with a mighty following
to join the muster came
the tusculan mamilius
prince of the latian name

but by the yellow tiber
was tumult and affright
from all the spacious champaign
to rome men took their flight
a mile around the city
the throng stopped up the ways
a fearful sight it was to see
through two long nights and days

now, from the rock tarpeian
could the wan burghers spy
the line of blazing villages
red in the midnight sky
the fathers of the city
they sat all night and day
for every hour some horseman came
with tidings of dismay

to eastward and to westward
have spread the tuscan bands
nor house, nor fence, nor dovecot
in crustumerium stands
verbenna down to ostia
hath wasted all the plain
astur hath stormed janiculum
and the stout guards are slain

i wis, in all the senate
there was no heart so bold
but sore it ached, and fast it beat
when that ill news was told
forthwith up rose the consul
up rose the fathers all
in haste they girded up their gowns
and hied them to the wall

they held a council standing
before the river gate
short time was there, ye well may guess
for musing or debate
out spoke the consul roundly
for, since janiculum is lost
naught else can save the town

just then a scout came flying
all wild with haste and fear
lars porsena is here
on the low hills to westward
the consul fixed his eye
and saw the swarthy storm of dust
rise fast along the sky

and nearer, fast, and nearer
doth the red whirlwind come
and louder still, and still more loud
from underneath that rolling cloud
is heard the trumpet's war-note proud
the trampling and the hum
and plainly and more plainly
now through the gloom appears
far to left and far to right
in broken gleams of dark-blue light
the long array of helmets bright
the long array of spears

and plainly and more plainly
above the glimmering line
now might ye see the banners
of twelve fair cities shine
but the banner of proud clusium
was the highest of them all
the terror of the umbrian
the terror of the gaul

fast by the royal standard
o'erlooking all the war
lars porsena of clusium
sat in his ivory car
by the right wheel rode mamilius
prince of the latian name
and by the left false sextus
that wrought the deed of shame

but when the face of sextus
was seen among the foes
a yell that rent the firmament
from all the town arose
on the house-tops was no woman
but spat toward him and hissed
no child but screamed out curses
and shook its little fist

but the consul's brow was sad
and the consul's speech was low
and darkly looked he at the wall
and darkly at the foe
before the bridge goes down
and if they once may win the bridge
what hope to save the town

then out spake brave horatius
the captain of the gate
death cometh soon or late
and how can man die better
than facing fearful odds
for the ashes of his fathers
and the temples of his gods

who dandled him to rest
and for the wife who nurses
his baby at her breast
and for the holy maidens
who feed the eternal flame
to save them from false sextus
that wrought the deed of shame

with all the speed ye may
i, with two more to help me
will hold the foe in play
in yon straight path a thousand
may well be stopped by three
now who will stand on either hand
and keep the bridge with me

then out spake spurius lartius
a ramnian proud was he
i will stand at thy right hand
and keep the bridge with thee
and out spake strong herminius
of titian blood was he
and keep the bridge with thee

and straight against that great array
forth went the dauntless three
for romans in rome's quarrel
spared neither land nor gold
nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life
in the brave days of old

now while the three were tightening
their harness on their backs
the consul was the foremost man
to take in hand an ax
and fathers mixed with commons
seized hatchet, bar, and crow
and smote upon the planks above
and loosed the props below
meanwhile the tuscan army
right glorious to behold
came flashing back the noonday light
rank behind rank, like surges bright
of a broad sea of gold

four hundred trumpets sounded
a peal of warlike glee
as that great host, with measured tread
and spears advanced, and ensigns spread
rolled slowly toward the bridge's head
where stood the dauntless three

the three stood calm and silent
and looked upon the foes
and a great shout of laughter
from all the vanguard rose
and forth three chiefs came spurring
before that deep array
to earth they sprang, their swords they drew
and lifted high their shields, and flew
to win the narrow way

aunus from green tifernum
lord of the hill of vines
and seius, whose eight hundred slaves
sicken in ilva's mines
and picus, long to clusium
vassal in peace and war
who led to fight his umbrian powers
from that gray crag where, girt with towers
the fortress of nequinum lowers
o'er the pale waves of nar

stout lartius hurled down aunus
into the stream beneath
herminius struck at seius
and clove him to the teeth
at picus brave horatius
darted one fiery thrust
and the proud umbrian's gilded arms
clashed in the bloody dust

then ocnus of falerii
rushed on the roman three
and lausulus of urgo
the rover of the sea
and aruns of volsinium
who slew the great wild boar
the great wild boar that had his den
amid the reeds of cosa's fen
and wasted fields and slaughtered men
along albinia's shore

herminius smote down aruns
lartius laid ocnus low
right to the heart of lausulus
horatius sent a blow
no more, aghast and pale
from ostia's walls the crowd shall mark
the tracks of thy destroying bark
no more campania's hinds shall fly
to woods and caverns when they spy
thy thrice accurséd sail

but now no sound of laughter
was heard among the foes
a wild and wrathful clamour
from all the vanguard rose
six spears' length from the entrance
halted that deep array
and for a space no man came forth
to win the narrow way

but hark! the cry is astur
and lo! the ranks divide
and the great lord of luna
comes with his stately stride
upon his ample shoulders
clangs loud the fourfold shield
and in his hand he shakes the brand
which none but he can wield

he smiled on those bold romans
a smile serene and high
he eyed the flinching tuscans
and scorn was in his eye
quoth he: "the she-wolf's litter
stand savagely at bay
but will ye dare to follow
if astur clears the way

then, whirling up his broadsword
with both hands to the height
he rushed against horatius
and smote with all his might
with shield and blade horatius
right deftly turned the blow
the blow, though turned, came yet too nigh
it missed his helm, but gashed his thigh
the tuscans raised a joyful cry
to see the red blood flow

he reeled, and on herminius
he leaned one breathing space
then, like a wildcat mad with wounds
sprang right at astur's face
through teeth, and skull, and helmet
so fierce a thrust he sped
the good sword stood a handbreadth out
behind the tuscan's head

and the great lord of luna
fell at the deadly stroke
as falls on mount alvernus
a thunder-smitten oak
far o'er the crashing forest
the giant arms lie spread
and the pale augurs, muttering low
gaze on the blasted head

on astur's throat horatius
right firmly pressed his heel
and thrice and four times tugged amain
ere he wrenched out the steel
fair guests, that waits you here
what noble lucumo comes next
to taste our roman cheer

but at his haughty challenge
a sullen murmur ran
mingled of wrath, and shame, and dread
along that glittering van
there lacked not men of prowess
nor men of lordly race
for all etruria's noblest
were round the fatal place

but all etruria's noblest
felt their hearts sink to see
on the earth the bloody corpses
in the path the dauntless three
and, from the ghastly entrance
where those bold romans stood
all shrank, like boys who unaware
ranging the woods to start a hare
come to the mouth of the dark lair
where, growling low, a fierce old bear
lies amid bones and blood

was none who would be foremost
to lead such dire attack
but those behind cried "forward
and those before cried "back
and backward now and forward
wavers the deep array
and on the tossing sea of steel
to and fro the standards reel
and the victorious trumpet peal
dies fitfully away

yet one man for one moment
strode out before the crowd
well known was he to all the three
and they gave him greeting loud
now welcome to thy home
why dost thou stay, and turn away
here lies the road to rome

thrice looked he at the city
thrice looked he at the dead
and thrice came on in fury
and thrice turned back in dread
and, white with fear and hatred
scowled at the narrow way
where, wallowing in a pool of blood
the bravest tuscans lay

but meanwhile ax and lever
have manfully been plied
and now the bridge hangs tottering
above the boiling tide
loud cried the fathers all
back, ere the ruin fall

back darted spurius lartius
herminius darted back
and, as they passed, beneath their feet
they felt the timbers crack
but when they turned their faces
and on the farther shore
saw brave horatius stand alone
they would have crossed once more

but with a crash like thunder
fell every loosened beam
and, like a dam, the mighty wreck
lay right athwart the stream
and a long shout of triumph
rose from the walls of rome
as to the highest turret tops
was splashed the yellow foam

and, like a horse unbroken
when first he feels the rein
the furious river struggled hard
and tossed his tawny mane
and burst the curb, and bounded
rejoicing to be free
and whirling down, in fierce career
battlement, and plank, and pier
rushed headlong to the sea

alone stood brave horatius
but constant still in mind
thrice thirty thousand foes before
and the broad flood behind
with a smile on his pale face

round turned he, as not deigning
those craven ranks to see
naught spake he to lars porsena
to sextus naught spake he
but he saw on palatinus
the white porch of his home
and he spake to the noble river
that rolls by the towers of rome

to whom the romans pray
a roman's life, a roman's arms
take thou in charge this day
so he spake, and speaking sheathed
the good sword by his side
and, with his harness on his back
plunged headlong in the tide

no sound of joy or sorrow
was heard from either bank
but friends and foes in dumb surprise
with parted lips and straining eyes
stood gazing where he sank
and when above the surges
they saw his crest appear
all rome sent forth a rapturous cry
and even the ranks of tuscany
could scarce forbear to cheer

and fiercely ran the current
swollen high by months of rain
and fast his blood was flowing
and he was sore in pain
and heavy with his armour
and spent with changing blows
and oft they thought him sinking
but still again he rose

never, i ween, did swimmer
in such an evil case
struggle through such a raging flood
safe to the landing place
but his limbs were borne up bravely
by the brave heart within
and our good father tiber
bore bravely up his chin

but for this stay, ere close of day
we should have sacked the town
for such a gallant feat of arms
was never seen before

and now he feels the bottom
now on dry earth he stands
now round him throng the fathers
to press his gory hands
and now with shouts and clapping
and noise of weeping loud
he enters through the river gate
borne by the joyous crowd

they gave him of the corn land
that was of public right
as much as two strong oxen
could plow from morn till night
and they made a molten image
and set it up on high
and there it stands unto this day
to witness if i lie

it stands in the comitium
plain for all folk to see
horatius in his harness
halting upon one knee
and underneath is written
in letters all of gold
how valiantly he kept the bridge
in the brave days of old

and still his name sounds stirring
unto the men of rome
as the trumpet blast that cries to them
to charge the volscian home
and wives still pray to juno
for boys with hearts as bold
as his who kept the bridge so well
in the brave days of old

and in the nights of winter
when the cold north winds blow
and the long howling of the wolves
is heard amid the snow
when round the lonely cottage
roars loud the tempest's din
and the good logs of algidus
roar louder yet within

when the oldest cask is opened
and the largest lamp is lit
when the chestnuts glow in the embers
and the kid turns on the spit
when young and old in circle
around the firebrands close
when the girls are weaving baskets
and the lads are shaping bows

when the goodman mends his armour
and trims his helmet's plume
when the goodwife's shuttle merrily
goes flashing through the loom
with weeping and with laughter
still is the story told
how well horatius kept the bridge
in the brave days of old



day" exercises. the planting of trees as against their destruction is a
vital point in our political and national welfare. william cullen
bryant (1794-1878

come, let us plant the apple-tree
cleave the tough greensward with the spade
wide let its hollow bed be made
there gently lay the roots, and there
sift the dark mould with kindly care
and press it o'er them tenderly
as round the sleeping infant's feet
we softly fold the cradle sheet
so plant we the apple-tree

what plant we in this apple-tree
buds, which the breath of summer days
shall lengthen into leafy sprays
boughs where the thrush, with crimson breast
shall haunt, and sing, and hide her nest
we plant, upon the sunny lea
a shadow for the noontide hour
a shelter from the summer shower
when we plant the apple-tree

what plant we in this apple-tree
sweets for a hundred flowery springs
to load the may wind's restless wings
when, from the orchard row, he pours
its fragrance through our open doors
a world of blossoms for the bee
flowers for the sick girl's silent room
for the glad infant sprigs of bloom
we plant with the apple-tree

what plant we in this apple-tree
fruits that shall swell in sunny june
and redden in the august noon
and drop, when gentle airs come by
that fan the blue september sky
while children come, with cries of glee
and seek them where the fragrant grass
betrays their bed to those who pass
at the foot of the apple-tree

and when, above this apple-tree
the winter stars are quivering bright
the winds go howling through the night
girls, whose eyes o'erflow with mirth
shall peel its fruit by cottage hearth
and guests in prouder homes shall see
heaped with the grape of cintra's vine
and golden orange of the line
the fruit of the apple-tree

the fruitage of this apple-tree
winds and our flag of stripe and star
shall bear to coasts that lie afar
where men shall wonder at the view
and ask in what fair groves they grew
and sojourners beyond the sea
shall think of childhood's careless day
and long, long hours of summer play
in the shade of the apple-tree

each year shall give this apple-tree
a broader flush of roseate bloom
a deeper maze of verdurous gloom
and loosen, when the frost-clouds lower
the crisp brown leaves in thicker shower
the years shall come and pass, but we
shall hear no longer, where we lie
the summer's songs, the autumn's sigh
in the boughs of the apple-tree

and time shall waste this apple-tree
oh, when its aged branches throw
thin shadows on the ground below
shall fraud and force and iron will
oppress the weak and helpless still
what shall the tasks of mercy be
amid the toils, the strifes, the tears
of those who live when length of years
is wasting this apple-tree

the children of that distant day
thus to some aged man shall say
and, gazing on its mossy stem
the gray-haired man shall answer them
born in the rude but good old times
on planting the apple-tree




on and on


vision of sir launfal." it finds a place in this volume because it is
the most perfect description of a charming day ever written

what is so rare as a day in june
then, if ever, come perfect days
then heaven tries the earth if it be in tune
and over it softly her warm ear lays
whether we look, or whether we listen
we hear life murmur, or see it glisten
every clod feels a stir of might
an instinct within it that reaches and towers
and, groping blindly above it for light
climbs to a soul in grass and flowers
the flush of life may well be seen
thrilling back over hills and valleys
the cowslip startles in meadows green
the buttercup catches the sun in its chalice
and there's never a leaf nor a blade too mean
to be some happy creature's palace
the little bird sits at his door in the sun
atilt like a blossom among the leaves
and lets his illumined being o'errun
with the deluge of summer it receives
his mate feels the eggs beneath her wings
and the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings
he sings to the wide world, and she to her nest
in the nice ear of nature which song is the best




laid up in heaven. it should be learned for its future value to the
child, not necessarily because the child likes it. its value will dawn
on him

tell me not, in mournful numbers
life is but an empty dream
for the soul is dead that slumbers
and things are not what they seem

life is real! life is earnest
and the grave is not its goal
dust thou art, to dust returnest
was not spoken of the soul

not enjoyment, and not sorrow
is our destined end or way
but to act, that each to-morrow
find us farther than to-day

art is long, and time is fleeting
and our hearts, though stout and brave
still, like muffled drums, are beating
funeral marches to the grave

in the world's broad field of battle
in the bivouac of life
be not like dumb, driven cattle
be a hero in the strife

trust no future, howe'er pleasant
let the dead past bury its dead
act,--act in the living present
heart within, and god o'erhead

lives of great men all remind us
we can make our lives sublime
and, departing, leave behind us
footprints on the sands of time

footprints, that perhaps another
sailing o'er life's solemn main
a forlorn and shipwrecked brother
seeing, shall take heart again

let us, then, be up and doing
with a heart for any fate
still achieving, still pursuing
learn to labour and to wait



connection with my lessons on natural history. we have a good specimen
of a barnacle, and the children see them on the shells on the coast
the ethical point is invaluable

my soul is sailing through the sea
but the past is heavy and hindereth me
the past hath crusted cumbrous shells
that hold the flesh of cold sea-mells
about my soul
the huge waves wash, the high waves roll
each barnacle clingeth and worketh dole
and hindereth me from sailing

old past, let go, and drop i' the sea
till fathomless waters cover thee
for i am living, but thou art dead
thou drawest back, i strive ahead
the day to find
thy shells unbind! night comes behind
i needs must hurry with the wind
and trim me best for sailing



how happy is he born and taught
that serveth not another's will
whose armour is his honest thought
and simple truth his utmost skill

whose passions not his master's are
whose soul is still prepared for death
not tied unto the world with care
of public fame, or private breath



reaches into the heart. what is home? a place where we experience
independence, safety, privacy, and where we can dispense hospitality

be it ever so humble, there's no place like home
a charm from the sky seems to hallow us there
which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere
home! home! sweet, sweet home
there's no place like home! there's no place like home

an exile from home, splendour dazzles in vain
o, give me my lowly thatched cottage again
the birds singing gaily, that came at my call
give me them,--and the peace of mind, dearer than all
home! home! sweet, sweet home
there's no place like home! there's no place like home

how sweet 'tis to sit 'neath a fond father's smile
and the cares of a mother to soothe and beguile
let others delight 'mid new pleasures to roam
but give me, oh, give me, the pleasures of home
home! home! sweet, sweet home
there's no place like home! there's no place like home

to thee i'll return, overburdened with care
the heart's dearest solace will smile on me there
no more from that cottage again will i roam
be it ever so humble, there's no place like home
home! home! sweet, sweet home
there's no place like home! there's no place like home




i heard last night a little child go singing
the same words still on notes he went in search
so high for, you concluded the upspringing
of such a nimble bird to sky from perch
must leave the whole bush in a tremble green
and that the heart of italy must beat
while such a voice had leave to rise serene
a little child, too, who not long had been
by mother's finger steadied on his feet
and still _o bella libertà_ he sang



in this collection because i have loved it all my life, and i never
knew any one who could or would offer a criticism upon it. its value
lies in its recognition of childhood's pleasures

woodman, spare that tree
touch not a single bough
in youth it sheltered me
and i'll protect it now
that placed it near his cot
there, woodman, let it stand
thy ax shall harm it not

that old familiar tree
whose glory and renown
are spread o'er land and sea
and wouldst thou hew it down
woodman, forbear thy stroke
cut not its earth-bound ties
oh, spare that agèd oak
now towering to the skies

when but an idle boy
i sought its grateful shade
in all their gushing joy
here, too, my sisters played
my mother kissed me here
my father pressed my hand
forgive this foolish tear
but let that old oak stand

my heart-strings round thee cling
close as thy bark, old friend
here shall the wild-bird sing
and still thy branches bend
old tree! the storm still brave
and, woodman, leave the spot
while i've a hand to save
thy ax shall harm it not



longing for the unchanging and to our love of security

abide with me! fast falls the eventide
the darkness deepens; lord, with me abide
when other helpers fail, and comforts flee
help of the helpless, o abide with me

swift to its close ebbs out life's little day
earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away
change and decay in all around i see
o thou who changest not, abide with me



cardinal newman was in the stress and strain of perplexity and mental
distress and bodily pain. the poem has been a star in the darkness to
thousands. it was the favourite poem of president mckinley

lead, kindly light, amid th' encircling gloom
lead thou me on
the night is dark, and i am far from home
lead thou me on
keep thou my feet; i do not ask to see
the distant scene; one step enough for me

i was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
shouldst lead me on
i loved to choose and see my path; but now
lead thou me on
i loved the garish day; and, spite of fears
pride ruled my will: remember not past years

so long thy power hath blest me, sure it still
will lead me on
o'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
the night is gone
and with the morn those angel faces smile
which i have loved long since, and lost a while



left blooming alone
all her lovely companions
are faded and gone
no flower of her kindred
no rose-bud is nigh
to reflect back her blushes
or give sigh for sigh

i'll not leave thee, thou lone one
to pine on the stem
since the lovely are sleeping
go, sleep thou with them
thus kindly i scatter
thy leaves o'er the bed
where thy mates of the garden
lie scentless and dead

so soon may i follow
when friendships decay
and from love's shining circle
the gems drop away
when true hearts lie withered
and fond ones are flown
o! who would inhabit
this bleak world alone



popular song on earth. written by william douglas

maxwelton braes are bonnie
where early fa's the dew
and it's there that annie laurie
gie'd me her promise true
gie'd me her promise true
which ne'er forgot will be
and for bonnie annie laurie
i'd lay me doune and dee

her brow is like the snawdrift
her throat is like the swan
her face it is the fairest
that e'er the sun shone on
that e'er the sun shone on
and dark blue is her e'e
and for bonnie annie laurie
i'd lay me doune and dee

like dew on the gowan lying
is the fa' o' her fairy feet
like the winds in summer sighing
her voice is low and sweet
her voice is low and sweet
and she's a' the world to me
and for bonnie annie laurie
i'd lay me doune and dee



a president of a well-known college writes me that "the ship of state
was his favourite poem when he was a boy, and did more than any other
to shape his course in life. longfellow (1807-82

sail on, sail on, o ship of state
sail on, o union, strong and great
humanity, with all its fears
with all the hopes of future years
is hanging breathless on thy fate
we know what master laid thy keel
what workmen wrought thy ribs of steel
who made each mast, and sail, and rope
what anvils rang, what hammers beat
in what a forge and what a heat
were forged the anchors of thy hope
fear not each sudden sound and shock
and not a rent made by the gale
in spite of rock, and tempest roar
in spite of false lights on the shore
sail on, nor fear to breast the sea
our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee
our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears
our faith, triumphant o'er our fears
are all with thee, are all with thee


the constitution and laws are here personified, and addressed as "the
ship of state


poem, regardless of the fact that every american who can sing it ought
to know it, that he may join in the chorus when patriotic celebrations
call for it. my boys love to repeat the entire poem, but i often find
masses of people trying to sing it, knowing only one stanza. it is our
national anthem, and a part of our education to know every word of it

my country, 'tis of thee
sweet land of liberty
of thee i sing
land where my fathers died
land of the pilgrims' pride
from every mountain side
let freedom ring

my native country, thee
land of the noble free
thy name i love
i love thy rocks and rills
thy woods and templed hills
my heart with rapture thrills
like that above

let music swell the breeze
and ring from all the trees
sweet freedom's song
let mortal tongues awake
let all that breathe partake
let rocks their silence break
the sound prolong

our fathers' god, to thee
author of liberty
to thee we sing
long may our land be bright
with freedom's holy light
protect us by thy might
great god, our king



that children want when they study the early history of america

the breaking waves dashed high
on a stern and rock-bound coast
and the woods against a stormy sky
their giant branches tossed

and the heavy night hung dark
the hills and waters o'er
when a band of exiles moored their bark
on the wild new england shore

not as the conqueror comes
they, the true-hearted, came
not with the roll of the stirring drums
and the trumpet that sings of fame

not as the flying come
in silence and in fear
they shook the depths of the desert gloom
with their hymns of lofty cheer

amid the storm they sang
and the stars heard, and the sea
and the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang
to the anthem of the free

the ocean eagle soared
from his nest by the white wave's foam
and the rocking pines of the forest roared
this was their welcome home

there were men with hoary hair
amid that pilgrim band
why had _they_ come to wither there
away from their childhood's land

there was woman's fearless eye
lit by her deep love's truth
there was manhood's brow serenely high
and the fiery heart of youth

what sought they thus afar
bright jewels of the mine
the wealth of seas, the spoils of war
they sought a faith's pure shrine

ay! call it holy ground
the soil where first they trod
they have left unstained what there they found
freedom to worship god



the main idea in "the lotos-eaters" is, are we justified in running
away from unpleasant duties? or, is insensibility justifiable

laddie, do you recollect learning this poem after we had read the story
of "odysseus"? "the struggle of the soul urged to action, but held back
by the spirit of self-indulgence." these were the points we discussed
alfred tennyson (1809-92

in the afternoon they came unto a land
in which it seemed always afternoon
all round the coast the languid air did swoon
breathing like one that hath a weary dream
full-faced above the valley stood the moon
and like a downward smoke, the slender stream
along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem

a land of streams! some, like a downward smoke
slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go
and some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke
rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below
they saw the gleaming river seaward flow
from the inner land: far off, three mountain-tops
three silent pinnacles of agèd snow
stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery drops
up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse

the charmèd sunset linger'd low adown
in the red west: thro' mountain clefts the dale
was seen far inland, and the yellow down
border'd with palm, and many a winding vale
and meadow, set with slender galingale
a land where all things always seem'd the same
and round about the keel with faces pale
dark faces pale against that rosy flame
the mild-eyed melancholy lotos-eaters came

branches they bore of that enchanted stem
laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave
to each, but whoso did receive of them
and taste, to him the gushing of the wave
far, far away did seem to mourn and rave
on alien shores; and if his fellow spake
his voice was thin, as voices from the grave
and deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake
and music in his ears his beating heart did make

they sat them down upon the yellow sand
between the sun and moon upon the shore
and sweet it was to dream of fatherland
of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore
most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar
weary the wandering fields of barren foam
then some one said, "we will return no more
and all at once they sang, "our island home
is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam



presentation of the value of integrity. this poem ranks with "sir
galahad," if not above it. it is a stroke of genius, and every american
ought to be proud of it. every time my boys read "odysseus" or the
story of ulysses with me we read or learn "moly." the plant moly grows
in the united states as well as in europe

traveller, pluck a stem of moly
if thou touch at circe's isle
hermes' moly, growing solely
to undo enchanter's wile
when she proffers thee her chalice
wine and spices mixed with malice
when she smites thee with her staff
to transform thee, do thou laugh
safe thou art if thou but bear
the least leaf of moly rare
close it grows beside her portal
springing from a stock immortal
yes! and often has the witch
sought to tear it from its niche
but to thwart her cruel will
the wise god renews it still
though it grows in soil perverse
heaven hath been its jealous nurse
and a flower of snowy mark
springs from root and sheathing dark
kingly safeguard, only herb
that can brutish passion curb
some do think its name should be
shield-heart, white integrity
traveller, pluck a stem of moly
if thou touch at circe's isle
hermes' moly, growing solely
to undo enchanter's wile



my campasbe" (1558-1606) are three dainty poems recommended by mrs
margaret mooney, of the albany teachers' college, in her "foundation
studies in literature." children are always delighted with them

t'other day as i was twining
roses, for a crown to dine in
what, of all things, 'mid the heap
should i light on, fast asleep
but the little desperate elf
the tiny traitor, love, himself
by the wings i picked him up
like a bee, and in a cup
of my wine i plunged and sank him
then what d'ye think i did?--i drank him
faith, i thought him dead. not he
there he lives with tenfold glee
and now this moment with his wings
i feel him tickling my heart-strings



cupid once upon a bed
of roses laid his weary head
luckless urchin, not to see
within the leaves a slumbering bee
the bee awak'd--with anger wild
the bee awak'd, and stung the child
loud and piteous are his cries
to venus quick he runs, he flies
i die with pain--in sooth i do
stung by some little angry thing
some serpent on a tiny wing
a bee it was--for once, i know
i heard a rustic call it so
thus he spoke, and she the while
heard him with a soothing smile
then said, "my infant, if so much
thou feel the little wild bee's touch
how must the heart, ah, cupid! be
the hapless heart that's stung by thee



cupid and my campasbe played
at cards for kisses. cupid paid
he stakes his quiver, bow and arrows
his mother's doves and team of sparrows
loses them, too; then down he throws
the coral of his lips, the rose
growing on his cheek, but none knows how
with them the crystal of his brow
and then the dimple of his chin
all these did my campasbe win
at last he set her both his eyes
she won and cupid blind did rise
oh, love, hath she done this to thee
what shall, alas, become of me



violo roseboro, one of our good authors, brought to me "a ballad for a
boy," saying: "i believe it is one of the poems that every child ought
to know." it is included in this compilation out of respect to her
opinion and also because the boys to whom i have read it said it was
to settle their own disputes by a hand-to-hand fight, but they will
always help each other when a third party or the elements interfere
humanity is greater than human interests

when george the third was reigning, a hundred years ago
he ordered captain farmer to chase the foreign foe
so cruise about the west of france in the frigate called _quebec

king george the second sent a man called general wolfe, you know
to clamber up a precipice and look into quebec
as you'd look down a hatchway when standing on the deck

before he got inside the town he died, i must allow
but since the town was won for us it is a lucky name
and you'll remember wolfe's good work, and you shall do the same

then farmer said, "i'll try, sir," and farmer bowed so low
that george could see his pigtail tied in a velvet bow
george gave him his commission, and that it might be safer
signed "king of britain, king of france," and sealed it with a wafer

then proud was captain farmer in a frigate of his own
and grander on his quarter-deck than george upon his throne
he'd two guns in his cabin, and on the spar-deck ten
and twenty on the gun-deck, and more than ten-score men

and as a huntsman scours the brakes with sixteen brace of dogs
with two-and-thirty cannon the ship explored the fogs
from cape la hogue to ushant, from rochefort to belleisle
she hunted game till reef and mud were rubbing on her keel

the fogs are dried, the frigate's side is bright with melting tar
the lad up in the foretop sees square white sails afar
the east wind drives three square-sailed masts from out the breton bay
and "clear for action!" farmer shouts, and reefers yell "hooray

the frenchmen's captain had a name i wish i could pronounce
a breton gentleman was he, and wholly free from bounce
one like those famous fellows who died by guillotine
for honour and the fleur-de-lys, and antoinette the queen

the catholic for louis, the protestant for george
each captain drew as bright a sword as saintly smiths could forge
and both were simple seamen, but both could understand
how each was bound to win or die for flag and native land

the french ship was _la surveillante_, which means the watchful maid
she folded up her head-dress and began to cannonade
her hull was clean, and ours was foul; we had to spread more sail
on canvas, stays, and topsail yards her bullets came like hail

sore smitten were both captains, and many lads beside
and still to cut our rigging the foreign gunners tried
a sail-clad spar came flapping down athwart a blazing gun
we could not quench the rushing flames, and so the frenchman won

our quarter-deck was crowded, the waist was all aglow
men hung upon the taffrail half scorched, but loth to go
our captain sat where once he stood, and would not quit his chair
he bade his comrades leap for life, and leave him bleeding there

the guns were hushed on either side, the frenchmen lowered boats
they flung us planks and hen-coops, and everything that floats
they risked their lives, good fellows! to bring their rivals aid
twas by the conflagration the peace was strangely made

they had to dodge the east wind to reach the port of brest
and where the waves leapt lower and the riddled ship went slower
in triumph, yet in funeral guise, came fisher-boats to tow her

they dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for farmer dead
and as the wounded captives passed each breton bowed the head
then spoke the french lieutenant, "twas fire that won, not we
you never struck your flag to us; you'll go to england free

twas the sixth day of october, seventeen hundred seventy-nine
a year when nations ventured against us to combine
but thanks be to the french book wherein they're not forgot

now you, if you've to fight the french, my youngster, bear in mind
those seamen of king louis so chivalrous and kind
think of the breton gentlemen who took our lads to brest
and treat some rescued breton as a comrade and a guest


it pure literature and good history

who, with thy hollow breast
still in rude armour drest
comest to daunt me
wrapt not in eastern balms
but with thy fleshless palms
stretched, as if asking alms
why dost thou haunt me

then from those cavernous eyes
pale flashes seemed to rise
as when the northern skies
gleam in december
and, like the water's flow
under december's snow
came a dull voice of woe
from the heart's chamber

my deeds, though manifold
no skald in song has told
no saga taught thee
take heed that in thy verse
thou dost the tale rehearse
else dread a dead man's curse
for this i sought thee

by the wild baltic's strand
i, with my childish hand
tamed the gerfalcon
and, with my skates fast-bound
skimmed the half-frozen sound
that the poor whimpering hound
trembled to walk on

tracked i the grizzly bear
while from my path the hare
fled like a shadow
oft through the forest dark
followed the were-wolf's bark
until the soaring lark
sang from the meadow

joining a corsair's crew
o'er the dark sea i flew
with the marauders
wild was the life we led
many the souls that sped
many the hearts that bled
by our stern orders

wore the long winter out
often our midnight shout
set the cocks crowing
as we the berserk's tale
measured in cups of ale
draining the oaken pail
filled to overflowing

tales of the stormy sea
soft eyes did gaze on me
burning yet tender
and as the white stars shine
on the dark norway pine
on that dark heart of mine
fell their soft splendour

yielding, yet half afraid
and in the forest's shade
our vows were plighted
under its loosened vest
fluttered her little breast
like birds within their nest
by the hawk frighted

shields gleamed upon the wall
loud sang the minstrels all
chanting his glory
when of old hildebrand
i asked his daughter's hand
mute did the minstrels stand
to hear my story

loud then the champion laughed
and as the wind-gusts waft
the sea-foam brightly
so the loud laugh of scorn
out of those lips unshorn
from the deep drinking-horn
blew the foam lightly

i but a viking wild
and though she blushed and smiled
i was discarded
should not the dove so white
follow the sea-mew's flight
why did they leave that night
her nest unguarded

bearing the maid with me
fairest of all was she
among the norsemen
when on the white sea-strand
waving his armed hand
saw we old hildebrand
with twenty horsemen

bent like a reed each mast
yet we were gaining fast
when the wind failed us
and with a sudden flaw
came round the gusty skaw
so that our foe we saw
laugh as he hailed us

round veered the flapping sail
midships with iron keel
struck we her ribs of steel
down her black hulk did reel
through the black water

sails the fierce cormorant
seeking some rocky haunt
with his prey laden
so toward the open main
beating to sea again
through the wild hurricane
bore i the maiden

and when the storm was o'er
cloud-like we saw the shore
stretching to leeward
there for my lady's bower
built i the lofty tower
which to this very hour
stands looking seaward

time dried the maiden's tears
she had forgot her fears
she was a mother
death closed her mild blue eyes
under that tower she lies
ne'er shall the sun arise
on such another

still as a stagnant fen
hateful to me were men
the sunlight hateful
in the vast forest here
clad in my warlike gear
fell i upon my spear
oh, death was grateful

bursting these prison bars
up to its native stars
my soul ascended
there from the flowing bowl
deep drinks the warrior's soul
thus the tale ended




tennyson's (1807-92) "the _revenge_" finds a welcome here because it is
a favourite with teachers of elocution and their audiences. it teaches
us to hold life cheap when the nation's safety is at stake

at flores in the azores sir richard grenville lay
and a pinnace, like a fluttered bird, came flying from away
then sware lord thomas howard: "'fore god, i am no coward
but i cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear
and the half my men are sick. i must fly, but follow quick
we are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three

then spake sir richard grenville: "i know you are no coward
you fly them for a moment, to fight with them again
but i've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore
i should count myself the coward if i left them, my lord howard
to these inquisition dogs and the devildoms of spain

so lord howard passed away with five ships of war that day
till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven
but sir richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land
very carefully and slow
men of bideford in devon
and we laid them on the ballast down below
for we brought them all aboard
and they blest him in their pain that they were not left to spain
to the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the lord

he had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight
and he sail'd away from flores till the spaniard came in sight
with his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow
good sir richard, tell us now
for to fight is but to die

and sir richard said again: "we be all good englishmen
let us bang these dogs of seville, the children of the devil
for i never turn'd my back upon don or devil yet

sir richard spoke and he laugh'd, and we roar'd a hurrah, and so
the little _revenge_ ran on sheer into the heart of the foe
with her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below
for half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen
and the little _revenge_ ran on thro' the long sea-lane between

thousands of their soldiers looked down from their decks and laugh'd
thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft
running on and on, till delay'd
by their mountain-like _san philip_ that, of fifteen hundred tons
and up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns
took the breath from our sails, and we stay'd

and while now the great _san philip_ hung above us like a cloud
whence the thunderbolt will fall
long and loud
four galleons drew away
from the spanish fleet that day
and two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay
and the battle-thunder broke from them all

but anon the great _san philip_, she bethought herself and went
having that within her womb that had left her ill content
and the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand
for a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers
and a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears
when he leaps from the water to the land

and the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea
but never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three
ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came
ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder
and flame
ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead
and her shame
for some were sunk and many were shatter'd, and so could
fight us no more
god of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before

for he said, "fight on! fight on
tho' his vessel was all but a wreck
and it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone
with a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck
but a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead
and himself he was wounded again in the side and the head
and he said, "fight on! fight on

and the night went down, and the sun smiled out far
over the summer sea
and the spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring
but they dared not touch us again, for they fear'd that
we still could sting
so they watched what the end would be
and we had not fought them in vain
but in perilous plight were we
seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain
and half of the rest of us maim'd for life
in the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife
and the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold
and the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was
all of it spent
and the masts and the rigging were lying over the side
but sir richard cried in his english pride
as may never be fought again
we have won great glory, my men
and a day less or more
at sea or ashore
we die--does it matter when
sink me the ship, master gunner--sink her, split her in twain
fall into the hands of god, not into the hands of spain

and the gunner said. "ay, ay," but the seamen made reply
and the lord hath spared our lives
we will make the spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go
we shall live to fight again, and to strike another blow
and the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe
and the stately spanish men to their flagship bore him then
where they laid him by the mast, old sir richard caught at last
and they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace
but he rose upon their decks, and he cried
i have only done my duty as a man is bound to do
with a joyful spirit i, sir richard grenville, die
and he fell upon their decks, and he died

and they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true
and had holden the power and glory of spain so cheap
that he dared her with one little ship and his english few
was he devil or man? he was devil for aught they knew
but they sank his body with honour down into the deep
and they mann'd the _revenge_ with a swarthier alien crew
and away she sail'd with her loss and long'd for her own
when a wind from the lands they had ruin'd awoke from sleep
and the water began to heave and the weather to moan
and or ever that evening ended a great gale blew
and a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew
till it smote on their hulls, and their sails, and their masts
and their flags
and the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter'd navy of spain
and the little _revenge_ herself went down by the island crags
to be lost evermore in the main



sir galahad is the most moral and upright of all the knights of the
round table. the strong lines of the poem (tennyson, 1809-92) are the
strong lines of human destiny

because my heart is pure

my good blade carves the casques of men
my tough lance thrusteth sure
my strength is as the strength of ten
because my heart is pure
the shattering trumpet shrilleth high
the hard brands shiver on the steel
the splintered spear-shafts crack and fly
the horse and rider reel
they reel, they roll in clanging lists
and when the tide of combat stands
perfume and flowers fall in showers
that lightly rain from ladies' hands

how sweet are looks that ladies bend
on whom their favours fall
for them i battle till the end
to save from shame and thrall
but all my heart is drawn above
my knees are bow'd in crypt and shrine
i never felt the kiss of love
nor maiden's hand in mine
more bounteous aspects on me beam
me mightier transports move and thrill
so keep i fair thro' faith and prayer
a virgin heart in work and will

when down the stormy crescent goes
a light before me swims
between dark stems the forest glows
i hear a noise of hymns
then by some secret shrine i ride
i hear a voice, but none are there
the stalls are void, the doors are wide
the tapers burning fair
fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth
the silver vessels sparkle clean
the shrill bell rings, the censer swings
and solemn chaunts resound between

sometimes on lonely mountain-meres
i find a magic bark
i leap on board: no helmsman steers
i float till all is dark
a gentle sound, an awful light
three angels bear the holy grail
with folded feet, in stoles of white
on sleeping wings they sail
ah, blessèd vision! blood of god
my spirit beats her mortal bars
as down dark tides the glory slides
and star-like mingles with the stars

when on my goodly charger borne
thro' dreaming towns i go
the cock crows ere the christmas morn
the streets are dumb with snow
the tempest crackles on the leads
and, ringing, springs from brand and mail
but o'er the dark a glory spreads
and gilds the driving hail
i leave the plain, i climb the height
no branchy thicket shelter yields
but blessèd forms in whistling storms
fly o'er waste fens and windy fields

a maiden knight--to me is given
such hope, i know not fear
i yearn to breathe the airs of heaven
that often meet me here
i muse on joy that will not cease
pure spaces cloth'd in living beams
pure lilies of eternal peace
whose odours haunt my dreams
and, stricken by an angel's hand
this mortal armour that i wear
this weight and size, this heart and eyes
are touch'd, are turn'd to finest air

the clouds are broken in the sky
and thro' the mountain-walls
a rolling organ-harmony
swells up, and shakes and falls
then move the trees, the copses nod
wings flutter, voices hover clear
ride on! the prize is near
so pass i hostel, hall, and grange
by bridge and ford, by park and pale
all-arm'd i ride, whate'er betide
until i find the holy grail



correct our ready overestimate of our own importance

alone i walked the ocean strand
a pearly shell was in my hand
i stooped and wrote upon the sand
my name--the year--the day
as onward from the spot i passed
one lingering look behind i cast
a wave came rolling high and fast
and washed my lines away

and so, methought, 'twill shortly be
with every mark on earth from me
a wave of dark oblivion's sea
will sweep across the place
where i have trod the sandy shore
of time, and been, to be no more
of me--my day--the name i bore
to leave nor track nor trace

and yet, with him who counts the sands
and holds the waters in his hands
i know a lasting record stands
inscribed against my name
of all this mortal part has wrought
of all this thinking soul has thought
and from these fleeting moments caught
for glory or for shame




the best is yet to be
the last of life, for which the first was made


attractive as years go on. the line in this poem that captivated my
youthful fancy was


the delight with which trees hang out their new little tassels every
year is one of the charms of "the pine family." john burroughs sent us
down a tiny hemlock, that grew in our window-box at school for five
years, and every spring it was a new joy on account of the fine, tender
tassels. mrs. hemans had a vivid imagination backed up by an abundant
information

i come, i come! ye have called me long
i come o'er the mountains, with light and song
ye may trace my step o'er the waking earth
by the winds which tell of the violet's birth
by the primrose stars in the shadowy grass
by the green leaves opening as i pass

i have breathed on the south, and the chestnut-flowers
by thousands have burst from the forest bowers
and the ancient graves and the fallen fanes
are veiled with wreaths on italian plains
but it is not for me, in my hour of bloom
to speak of the ruin or the tomb

i have looked o'er the hills of the stormy north
and the larch has hung all his tassels forth
the fisher is out on the sunny sea
and the reindeer bounds o'er the pastures free
and the pine has a fringe of softer green
and the moss looks bright, where my step has been

i have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh
and called out each voice of the deep blue sky
from the night-bird's lay through the starry time
in the groves of the soft hesperian clime
to the swan's wild note by the iceland lakes
when the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks

from the streams and founts i have loosed the chain
they are sweeping on to the silvery main
they are flashing down from the mountain brows
they are flinging spray o'er the forest boughs
they are bursting fresh from their sparry caves
and the earth resounds with the joy of waves



not expect children to appreciate fully, even when they care enough for
it to learn it. it is too long for most children to commit to memory
and i generally assign one stanza to one pupil and another to another
pupil until it is divided up among them. the poem is a masterpiece
doubtless the poet meant to show that the forsaken merman had a greater
soul to save than the woman who sought to save her soul by deserting
natural duty. salvation does not come through the faith that builds
itself at the expense of love

come, dear children, let us away
down and away below
now my brothers call from the bay
now the great winds shoreward blow
now the salt tides seaward flow
now the wild white horses play
champ and chafe and toss in the spray
children dear, let us away
this way, this way

call her once before you go
call once yet
in a voice that she will know
children's voices should be dear
children's voices, wild with pain
surely she will come again
call her once and come away
this way, this way
the wild white horses foam and fret
margaret! margaret

come, dear children, come away down
call no more
one last look at the white-wall'd town
and the little gray church on the windy shore
then come down
she will not come though you call all day
come away, come away

children dear, was it yesterday
we heard the sweet bells over the bay
in the caverns where we lay
through the surf and through the swell
the far-off sound of a silver bell
sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep
where the winds are all asleep
where the spent lights quiver and gleam
where the salt weed sways in the stream
where the sea-beasts, ranged all round
feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground
where the sea-snakes coil and twine
dry their mail and bask in the brine
where great whales come sailing by
sail and sail, with unshut eye
round the world forever and aye
when did music come this way
children dear, was it yesterday

children dear, was it yesterday
once she sate with you and me
on a red gold throne in the heart of the sea
and the youngest sate on her knee
she comb'd its bright hair, and she tended it well
when down swung the sound of a far-off bell
she sigh'd, she look'd up through the clear green sea
she said: "i must go, for my kinsfolk pray
in the little gray church on the shore to-day
and i lose my poor soul, merman! here with thee
i said: "go up, dear heart, through the waves
say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves
she smil'd, she went up through the surf in the bay
children dear, was it yesterday

children dear, were we long alone
long prayers," i said, "in the world they say
come!" i said; and we rose through the surf in the bay
we went up the beach, by the sandy down
where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall'd town
through the narrow pav'd streets, where all was still
to the little gray church on the windy hill
from the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers
but we stood without in the cold blowing airs
we climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains
and we gaz'd up the aisle through the small leaded panes
she sate by the pillar; we saw her clear
dear heart," i said, "we are long alone
the sea grows stormy, the little ones moan
but, ah, she gave me never a look
for her eyes were seal'd to the holy book
loud prays the priest: shut stands the door
come away, children, call no more
come away, come down, call no more

down, down, down
down to the depths of the sea
she sits at her wheel in the humming town
singing most joyfully
hark what she sings: "o joy, o joy
for the humming street, and the child with its toy
for the priest, and the bell, and the holy well
for the wheel where i spun
and the blessèd light of the sun
and so she sings her fill
singing most joyfully
till the spindle drops from her hand
and the whizzing wheel stands still
she steals to the window, and looks at the sand
and over the sand at the sea
and her eyes are set in a stare
and anon there breaks a sigh
and anon there drops a tear
from a sorrow-clouded eye
and a heart sorrow-laden
a long, long sigh
for the cold strange eyes of a little mermaiden
and the gleam of her golden hair

come away, away, children
come, children, come down
the hoarse wind blows colder
lights shine in the town
she will start from her slumber
when gusts shake the door
she will hear the winds howling
will hear the waves roar
we shall see, while above us
the waves roar and whirl
a ceiling of amber
a pavement of pearl
singing: "here came a mortal
but faithless was she
and alone dwell forever
the kings of the sea

but, children, at midnight
when soft the winds blow
when clear falls the moonlight
when spring-tides are low
when sweet airs come seaward
from heaths starr'd with broom
and high rocks throw mildly
on the blanch'd sands a gloom
up the still, glistening beaches
up the creeks we will hie
over banks of bright seaweed
the ebb-tide leaves dry
we will gaze, from the sand-hills
at the white, sleeping town
at the church on the hill-side
and then come back down
singing: "there dwells a lov'd one
but cruel is she
she left lonely forever
the kings of the sea



southwestern part of scotland. robert burns's old home it close to it
the house has low walls, a thatched roof, and only two rooms. alloway
kirk and the two bridges so famous in robert burns's verse are near by
this is an enchanted land, and the scotch people for miles around ayr
speak of the poet with sincere affection. burns, more than any other
poet, has thrown the enchantment of poetry over his own locality

ye banks and braes o' bonnie doon
how can ye blume sae fair
how can ye chant, ye little birds
and i sae fu' o' care

thou'lt break my heart, thou bonnie bird
that sings upon the bough
thou minds me o' the happy days
when my fause luve was true

thou'lt break my heart, thou bonnie bird
that sings beside thy mate
for sae i sat, and sae i sang
and wist na o' my fate

aft hae i rov'd by bonnie doon
to see the woodbine twine
and ilka bird sang o' its love
and sae did i o' mine

wi' lightsome heart i pu'd a rose
frae off its thorny tree
and my fause luver staw the rose
but left the thorn wi' me



oft in the stilly night
ere slumber's chain has bound me
fond memory brings the light
of other days around me
the smiles, the tears
of boyhood's years
the words of love then spoken
the eyes that shone
now dimmed and gone
the cheerful hearts now broken
thus in the stilly night
ere slumber's chain has bound me
sad memory brings the light
of other days around me

when i remember all
the friends so link'd together
i've seen around me fall
like leaves in wintry weather
i feel like one
who treads alone
some banquet-hall deserted
whose lights are fled
whose garlands dead
and all but he departed
thus in the stilly night
ere slumber's chain has bound me
sad memory brings the light
of other days around me



if john burroughs (1837-) had never written any other poem than "my own
shall come to me," he would have stood to all ages as one of the
greatest of american poets. the poem is most characteristic of the
tall, majestic, slow-going poet and naturalist. there is no greater
line in greek or english literature than


serene i fold my hands and wait
nor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea
i rave no more 'gainst time or fate
for lo! my own shall come to me

i stay my haste, i make delays
for what avails this eager pace
i stand amid the eternal ways
and what is mine shall know my face

asleep, awake, by night or day
the friends i seek are seeking me
no wind can drive my bark astray
nor change the tide of destiny

what matter if i stand alone
i wait with joy the coming years
my heart shall reap when it has sown
and gather up its fruit of tears

the stars come nightly to the sky
the tidal wave comes to the sea
nor time, nor space, nor deep, nor high
can keep my own away from me

the waters know their own and draw
the brook that springs in yonder heights
so flows the good with equal law
unto the soul of pure delights



assigned to "grammar grades" of schools. it is included here out of
respect to a boy of eleven years who was more impressed with these
lines than with any other lines in any poem

in the light of thought
singing songs unbidden
till the world is wrought
to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not

hail to thee, blithe spirit
bird thou never wert
that from heaven or near it
pourest thy full heart
in profuse strains of unpremeditated art

higher still and higher
from the earth thou springest
like a cloud of fire
the blue deep thou wingest
and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest

in the golden lightning
of the sunken sun
o'er which clouds are brightening
thou dost float and run
like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun

the pale purple even
melts around thy flight
like a star of heaven
in the broad daylight
thou art unseen, but yet i hear thy shrill delight

all the earth and air
with thy voice is loud
as, when night is bare
from one lonely cloud
the moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflowed

what thou art we know not
what is most like thee
from rainbow-clouds there flow not
drops so bright to see
as from thy presence showers a rain of melody

like a poet hidden
in the light of thought
singing hymns unbidden
till the world is wrought
to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not

teach us, sprite or bird
what sweet thoughts are thine
i have never heard
praise of love or wine
that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine

chorus hymeneal
or triumphal chaunt
matched with thine, would be all
but an empty vaunt
a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want

what objects are the fountains
of thy happy strain
what fields, or waves, or mountains
what shapes of sky or plain
what love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain

teach me half the gladness
that thy brain must know
such harmonious madness
from my lips would flow
the world should listen then, as i am listening now



i have often had the pleasure of riding across the coast from chester
england, to rhyl, on the north coast of wales, where stretch "the sands
of dee" (charles kingsley, 1819-75). these purple sands at low tide
stretch off into the sea miles away, and are said to be full of
quicksands

and call the cattle home
and call the cattle home
across the sands of dee
the western wind was wild and dark with foam
and all alone went she

the western tide crept up along the sand
and o'er and o'er the sand
and round and round the sand
as far as eye could see
the rolling mist came down and hid the land
and never home came she
oh! is it weed, or fish, or floating hair
a tress of golden hair
a drownèd maiden's hair
above the nets at sea
was never salmon yet that shone so fair
among the stakes on dee

they rowed her in across the rolling foam
the cruel crawling foam
the cruel hungry foam
to her grave beside the sea
but still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home
across the sands of dee



1770-1850) are two gems that can be valued only for the spirit of quiet
and modesty diffused by them

mine be a cot beside the hill
a bee-hive's hum shall soothe my ear
a willowy brook that turns a mill
with many a fall shall linger near

the swallow, oft, beneath my thatch
shall twitter from her clay-built nest
oft shall the pilgrim lift the latch
and share my meal, a welcome guest

around my ivied porch shall spring
each fragrant flower that drinks the dew
and lucy, at her wheel, shall sing
in russet gown and apron blue

the village church among the trees
where first our marriage-vows were given
with merry peals shall swell the breeze
and point with taper spire to heaven



she dwelt among the untrodden ways
beside the springs of dove
a maid whom there were none to praise
and very few to love

a violet by a mossy stone
half-hidden from the eye
fair as a star, when only one
is shining in the sky

she lived unknown, and few could know
when lucy ceased to be
but she is in her grave, and, oh
the difference to me



happy the man, whose wish and care
a few paternal acres bound
content to breathe his native air
in his own ground

whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread
whose flocks supply him with attire
whose trees in summer yield him shade
in winter fire

blest, who can unconcern'dly find
hours, days, and years slide soft away
in health of body, peace of mind
quiet by day

sound sleep by night; study and ease
together mixt, sweet recreation
and innocence, which most does please
with meditation

thus let me live, unseen, unknown
thus unlamented let me die
steal from the world, and not a stone
tell where i lie



please several teachers

john anderson, my jo, john
when we were first acquent

this sonnet the poetess has touched the power of wordsworth or keats
and placed herself among the immortals

the god of music dwelleth out of doors
all seasons through his minstrelsy we meet
breathing by field and covert haunting-sweet
from organ-lofts in forests old he pours
a solemn harmony: on leafy floors
to smooth autumnal pipes he moves his feet
or with the tingling plectrum of the sleet
in winter keen beats out his thrilling scores
leave me the reed unplucked beside the stream
and he will stoop and fill it with the breeze
leave me the viol's frame in secret trees
unwrought, and it shall wake a druid theme
leave me the whispering shell on nereid shores
the god of music dwelleth out of doors



poem is the supreme masterpiece of mrs. browning. the prime thought in
it is the sacrifice and pain that must go to make a poet of any genius


what was he doing, the great god pan
down in the reeds by the river
spreading ruin and scattering ban
splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat
and breaking the golden lilies afloat
with the dragon-fly on the river

he tore out a reed, the great god pan
from the deep cool bed of the river
the limpid water turbidly ran
and the broken lilies a-dying lay
and the dragon-fly had fled away
ere he brought it out of the river

high on the shore sat the great god pan
while turbidly flow'd the river
and hack'd and hew'd as a great god can
with his hard bleak steel at the patient reed
till there was not a sign of a leaf indeed
to prove it fresh from the river

he cut it short, did the great god pan
then drew the pith, like the heart of a man
steadily from the outside ring
and notched the poor dry empty thing
in holes, as he sat by the river

to make sweet music, they could succeed
then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed
he blew in power by the river

sweet, sweet, sweet, o pan
piercing sweet by the river
blinding sweet, o great god pan
the sun on the hill forgot to die
and the lilies reviv'd, and the dragon-fly
came back to dream on the river

yet half a beast is the great god pan
to laugh as he sits by the river
making a poet out of a man
the true gods sigh for the cost and pain
for the reed which grows nevermore again
as a reed with the reeds in the river



dramatic, and the music of the refrain has done much to make it
popular. but the pathos is that which endears it

the old mayor climb'd the belfry tower
the ringers ran by two, by three
good ringers, pull your best," quoth he
ply all your changes, all your swells
play uppe, 'the brides of enderby

men say it was a stolen tyde
the lord that sent it, he knows all
but in myne ears doth still abide
the message that the bells let fall
and there was naught of strange, beside
the flight of mews and peewits pied
by millions crouch'd on the old sea wall

i sat and spun within the doore
my thread brake off, i raised myne eyes
the level sun, like ruddy ore
lay sinking in the barren skies
and dark against day's golden death
she moved where lindis wandereth
my sonne's faire wife, elizabeth

ere the early dews were falling
farre away i heard her song
where the reedy lindis floweth
floweth, floweth
from the meads where melick groweth
faintly came her milking song

leave your meadow grasses mellow
mellow, mellow
quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow
come uppe, whitefoot, come uppe, lightfoot
quit the stalks of parsley hollow
hollow, hollow
come uppe, jetty, rise and follow
from the clovers lift your head
come uppe, whitefoot, come uppe, lightfoot
come uppe, jetty, rise and follow
jetty, to the milking shed

if it be long ay, long ago
when i beginne to think howe long
againe i hear the lindis flow
swift as an arrowe, sharpe and strong
and all the aire, it seemeth mee
bin full of floating bells (sayth shee
that ring the tune of enderby

alle fresh the level pasture lay
and not a shadowe mote be seene
save where full fyve good miles away
the steeple tower'd from out the greene
and lo! the great bell farre and wide
was heard in all the country side
that saturday at eventide

the swanherds where their sedges are
mov'd on in sunset's golden breath
the shepherde lads i heard afarre
and my sonne's wife, elizabeth
till floating o'er the grassy sea
came downe that kyndly message free
the "brides of mavis enderby

then some look'd uppe into the sky
and all along where lindis flows
to where the goodly vessels lie
and where the lordly steeple shows
they sayde, "and why should this thing be
what danger lowers by land or sea
they ring the tune of enderby

of pyrate galleys warping down
for shippes ashore beyond the scorpe
they have not spar'd to wake the towne
but while the west bin red to see
and storms be none, and pyrates flee
why ring 'the brides of enderby

i look'd without, and lo! my sonne
came riding downe with might and main
he rais'd a shout as he drew on
till all the welkin rang again
than my sonne's wife, elizabeth

the rising tide comes on apace
and boats adrift in yonder towne
go sailing uppe the market-place
he shook as one that looks on death

with her two bairns i marked her long
and ere yon bells beganne to play
afar i heard her milking song
he looked across the grassy lea
to right, to left, "ho, enderby
they rang "the brides of enderby

with that he cried and beat his breast
for, lo! along the river's bed
a mighty eygre rear'd his crest
and uppe the lindis raging sped
it swept with thunderous noises loud
shap'd like a curling snow-white cloud
or like a demon in a shroud

and rearing lindis backward press'd
shook all her trembling bankes amaine
then madly at the eygre's breast
flung uppe her weltering walls again
then bankes came downe with ruin and rout
then beaten foam flew round about
then all the mighty floods were out

so farre, so fast the eygre drave
the heart had hardly time to beat
before a shallow seething wave
sobb'd in the grasses at oure feet
the feet had hardly time to flee
before it brake against the knee
and all the world was in the sea

upon the roofe we sate that night
the noise of bells went sweeping by
i mark'd the lofty beacon light
stream from the church tower, red and high
a lurid mark and dread to see
and awsome bells they were to mee
that in the dark rang "enderby

they rang the sailor lads to guide
from roofe to roofe who fearless row'd
and i--my sonne was at my side
and yet the ruddy beacon glow'd
and yet he moan'd beneath his breath
o lost! my love, elizabeth

and didst thou visit him no more
thou didst, thou didst, my daughter deare
the waters laid thee at his doore
ere yet the early dawn was clear
thy pretty bairns in fast embrace
the lifted sun shone on thy face
downe drifted to thy dwelling-place

that flow strew'd wrecks about the grass
that ebbe swept out the flocks to sea
a fatal ebbe and flow, alas
to manye more than myne and mee
but each will mourn his own (she saith
and sweeter woman ne'er drew breath
than my sonne's wife, elizabeth

i shall never hear her more
by the reedy lindis shore
ere the early dews be falling
i shall never hear her song
where the sunny lindis floweth
goeth, floweth
from the meads where melick groweth
when the water winding down
onward floweth to the town

i shall never see her more
where the reeds and rushes quiver
shiver, quiver
stand beside the sobbing river
sobbing, throbbing, in its falling
to the sandy lonesome shore
i shall never hear her calling
mellow, mellow
quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow

quit your pipes of parsley hollow
hollow, hollow
come uppe, lightfoot, rise and follow
lightfoot, whitefoot
from your clovers lift the head
come uppe, jetty, follow, follow
jetty, to the milking shed



and most appealing poems a teacher can read to her pupils when teaching
early american history. the poem is full of magnificent lines, such as
audience of young people when correlated with the study of north
carolina and sir walter raleigh. the solitary, majestic character of
sir walter raleigh, his intrepidity while undergoing tortures inflicted
by a cowardly king, the ring of indignation--- all these make a weapon
for him stronger than the ax that beheaded him. in this poem he "has
the last word

goe, soule, the bodie's guest
upon a thanklesse arrant
feare not to touche the best
the truth shall be thy warrant
goe, since i needs must dye
and give the world the lye

goe tell the court it glowes
and shines like rotten wood
goe tell the church it showes
what's good, and doth no good
if church and court reply
then give them both the lye

tell potentates they live
acting by others' actions
not loved unlesse they give
not strong but by their factions
if potentates reply
give potentates the lye

tell men of high condition
that rule affairs of state
their purpose is ambition
their practice only hate
and if they once reply
then give them all the lye

tell zeale it lacks devotion
tell love it is but lust
tell time it is but motion
tell flesh it is but dust
and wish them not reply
for thou must give the lye

tell wit how much it wrangles
in tickle points of nicenesse
tell wisdome she entangles
herselfe in over-wisenesse
and if they do reply
straight give them both the lye

tell physicke of her boldnesse
tell skill it is pretension
tell charity of coldnesse
tell law it is contention
and as they yield reply
so give them still the lye

tell fortune of her blindnesse
tell nature of decay
tell friendship of unkindnesse
tell justice of delay
and if they dare reply
then give them all the lye

tell arts they have no soundnesse
but vary by esteeming
tell schooles they want profoundnesse
and stand too much on seeming
if arts and schooles reply
give arts and schooles the lye

commanded thee, done blabbing
although to give the lye
deserves no less than stabbing
yet stab at thee who will
no stab the soule can kill



sweeping assertion of the individual's right to self-development

when earth's last picture is painted, and the tubes are
twisted and dried
when the oldest colours have faded, and the youngest critic has died
we shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it--lie down
for an æon or two
till the master of all good workmen shall set us to work anew

and those who were good shall be happy: they shall sit
in a golden chair
they shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comet's hair
they shall find real saints to draw from--magdalene, peter, and paul
they shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all

and only the master shall praise us, and only the master shall blame
and no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame
but each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star
shall draw the thing as he sees it for the god of things as they are



comfort and control people who are shut up to the joys of
meditation--people to whom the world of activity is closed. to be
independent of things material--this is the soul's pleasure

my mind to me a kingdom is
such perfect joy therein i find
as far excels all earthly bliss
that god or nature hath assigned
though much i want that most would have
yet still my mind forbids to crave

content i live; this is my stay
i seek no more than may suffice
i press to bear no haughty sway
look, what i lack my mind supplies
lo, thus i triumph like a king
content with that my mind doth bring

i laugh not at another's loss
i grudge not at another's gain
no worldly wave my mind can toss
i brook that is another's bane
i fear no foe, nor fawn on friend
i loathe not life, nor dread mine end

my wealth is health and perfect ease
my conscience clear my chief defense
i never seek by bribes to please
nor by desert to give offense
thus do i live, thus will i die



the harp that once through tara's halls
the soul of music shed
now hangs as mute on tara's walls
as if that soul were fled
so sleeps the pride of former days
so glory's thrill is o'er
and hearts, that once beat high for praise
now feel that pulse no more

no more to chiefs and ladies bright
the harp of tara swells
the chord alone, that breaks at night
its tale of ruin tells
thus freedom now so seldom wakes
the only throb she gives
is when some heart indignant breaks
to show that still she lives



love because it is an elegant expression of something very dear and
homely

how dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood
when fond recollection presents them to view
the orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wild-wood
and every loved spot which my infancy knew
the wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it
the bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell
the cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it
and e'en the rude bucket that hung in the well
the old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket
the moss-covered bucket which hung in the well

that moss-covered vessel i hailed as a treasure
for often at noon, when returned from the field
i found it the source of an exquisite pleasure
the purest and sweetest that nature can yield
how ardent i seized it, with hands that were glowing
and quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell
then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing
and dripping with coolness, it rose from the well
the old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket
the moss-covered bucket arose from the well

how sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it
as poised on the curb it inclined to my lips
not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it
the brightest that beauty or revelry sips
and now, far removed from the loved habitation
the tear of regret will intrusively swell
as fancy reverts to my father's plantation
and sighs for the bucket that hangs in the well
the old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket
the moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well



many college men speak of it at once as the great poem of their
boyhood. the poem caught me when a child by its refrain and weird
picturesqueness. it has never outgrown its mechanical charm

once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door
only this, and nothing more

ah! distinctly i remember, it was in the bleak december
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
eagerly i wished the morrow; vainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
nameless here for evermore

and the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
this it is, and nothing more

presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer
but the fact is, i was napping, and so gently you came rapping
and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door
that i scarce was sure i heard you." here i opened wide the door
darkness there, and nothing more

deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there, wondering
fearing
doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
but the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token
and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "lenore
this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "lenore
merely this, and nothing more

back into my chamber turning, all my soul within me burning
soon again i heard a rapping, something louder than before
let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore
let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore

open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter
in there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of yore
not the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopped or stayed he
but with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
perched above a bust of pallas, just above my chamber door
perched, and sat, and nothing more

then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
sure, no craven
ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly shore
tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore
quoth the raven, "nevermore

much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
though its answer, little meaning, little relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
with such a name as "nevermore

but the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered
till i scarcely more than muttered--"other friends have flown before
on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before
then the bird said, "nevermore

startled by the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore
till the dirges of his hope this melancholy burden bore
of 'never, nevermore

but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling
straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and
bust, and door
then upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking
fancy into fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
meant in croaking "nevermore

thus i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core
this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
on the cushion's velvet lining, that the lamp-light gloated o'er
but whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o'er
she shall press, ah, nevermore

then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
swung by seraphim, whose footfalls twinkled on the tufted floor
hath sent thee
respite--respite and nepenthe from my memories of lenore
quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost lenore
quoth the raven, "nevermore

whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
on this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, i implore
is there--_is_ there balm in gilead?--tell me, tell me, i implore
quoth the raven, "nevermore

by that heaven that bends above us--by that god we both adore
tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if, within the distant aiden
it shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name lenore
clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name lenore
quoth the raven, "nevermore

leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
leave my loneliness unbroken--quit the bust above my door
take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven, "nevermore

and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas, just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming
and the lamp-light o'er him streaming, throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow, that lies floating on the floor
shall be lifted--nevermore



make way for liberty, and died
in arms the austrian phalanx stood
a living wall, a human wood
a wall, where every conscious stone
seemed to its kindred thousands grown
a rampart all assaults to bear
till time to dust their frames should wear
so still, so dense the austrians stood
a living wall, a human wood

impregnable their front appears
all horrent with projected spears
whose polished points before them shine
from flank to flank, one brilliant line
bright as the breakers' splendours run
along the billows to the sun

opposed to these a hovering band
contended for their fatherland
peasants, whose new-found strength had broke
from manly necks the ignoble yoke
and beat their fetters into swords
on equal terms to fight their lords
and what insurgent rage had gained
in many a mortal fray maintained
marshalled, once more, at freedom's call
they came to conquer or to fall
where he who conquered, he who fell
was deemed a dead or living tell
such virtue had that patriot breathed
so to the soil his soul bequeathed
that wheresoe'er his arrows flew
heroes in his own likeness grew
and warriors sprang from every sod
which his awakening footstep trod

and now the work of life and death
hung on the passing of a breath
the fire of conflict burned within
the battle trembled to begin
yet, while the austrians held their ground
point for attack was nowhere found
where'er the impatient switzers gazed
the unbroken line of lances blazed
that line 'twere suicide to meet
and perish at their tyrant's feet
how could they rest within their graves
and leave their homes, the homes of slaves
would not they feel their children tread
with clanging chains, above their head

it must not be; this day, this hour
annihilates the invader's power
all switzerland is in the field
she will not fly,--she cannot yield
she must not fall; her better fate
here gives her an immortal date
few were the numbers she could boast
but every freeman was a host
and felt as 'twere a secret known
that one should turn the scale alone
while each unto himself was he
on whose sole arm hung victory

it did depend on one indeed
behold him,--arnold winkelried
there sounds not to the trump of fame
the echo of a nobler name
unmarked he stood amid the throng
in rumination deep and long
till you might see, with sudden grace
the very thought come o'er his face
and, by the motion of his form
anticipate the bursting storm
and, by the uplifting of his brow
tell where the bolt would strike, and how

but 'twas no sooner thought than done
the field was in a moment won
then ran, with arms extended wide
as if his dearest friend to clasp
ten spears he swept within his grasp
their keen points crossed from side to side
he bowed amidst them like a tree
and thus made way for liberty

swift to the breach his comrades fly
and through the austrian phalanx dart
as rushed the spears through arnold's heart
while instantaneous as his fall
rout, ruin, panic, seized them all
an earthquake could not overthrow
a city with a surer blow

thus switzerland again was free
thus death made way for liberty



life! i know not what thou art
but know that thou and i must part
and when, or how, or where we met
i own to me's a secret yet
life! we've been long together
through pleasant and through cloudy weather
tis hard to part when friends are dear
perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear
choose thine own time
say not good night,--but in some brighter clime
bid me good morning



from "hamlet," and "antony's speech," from "julius cæsar" (all
fragments from shakespeare, 1564-1616), find a place in this book
because a well-known new york teacher--one who is unremitting in his
book of poetry could not be complete without these extracts

the quality of mercy is not strain'd
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd
it blesseth him that gives, and him that takes
the throned monarch better than his crown
his scepter shows the force of temporal power
the attribute to awe and majesty
wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
but mercy is above his sceptered sway
it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
it is an attribute to god himself
and earthly power doth then show likest god's
when mercy seasons justice

shakespeare ("merchant of venice


see thou character. give thy thoughts no tongue
nor any unproportion'd thought his act
be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar
the friends thou hast, and their adoption tried
grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. beware
of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in
bear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee
give every man thine ear, but few thy voice
take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
but not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy
for the apparel oft proclaims the man
neither a borrower nor a lender be
for loan oft loses both itself and friend
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
this above all: to thine own self be true
and it must follow, as the night the day
thou canst not then be false to any man

shakespeare ("hamlet


this was the noblest roman of them all
all the conspirators, save only he
did that they did in envy of great cæsar
he only, in a general honest thought
and common good to all, made one of them
his life was gentle; and the elements
so mix'd in him, that nature might stand up
and say to all the world, "this was a man

shakespeare ("julius cæsar


bird of the wilderness
blithesome and cumberless
sweet be thy matin o'er moorland and lea
emblem of happiness
blest is thy dwelling-place
oh, to abide in the desert with thee

wild is thy lay and loud
far in the downy cloud
love gives it energy, love gave it birth
where, on thy dewy wing
where art thou journeying
thy lay is in heaven, thy love is on earth

o'er fell and fountain sheen
o'er moor and mountain green
o'er the red streamer that heralds the day
over the cloudlet dim
over the rainbow's rim
musical cherub, soar, singing, away

then, when the gloaming comes
low in the heather blooms
sweet will thy welcome and bed of love be
emblem of happiness
blest is thy dwelling-place
oh, to abide in the desert with thee



exposition in poetry of this "shakespeare of prose

o, may i join the choir invisible
of those immortal dead who live again
in minds made better by their presence; live
in pulses stirred to generosity
in deeds of daring rectitude, in scorn
of miserable aims that end with self
in thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars
and with their mild persistence urge men's minds
to vaster issues
may i reach
that purest heaven,--be to other souls
the cup of strength in some great agony
enkindle generous ardour, feed pure love
beget the smiles that have no cruelty
be the sweet presence of good diffused
and in diffusion ever more intense
so shall i join the choir invisible
whose music is the gladness of the world



the greatest sonnet ever written. it is true that "the eyes of the
soul" are blinded by a surfeit of worldly "goods." "i went to the lake
district" (england), said john burroughs, "to see what kind of a
country could produce a wordsworth." of course he found simple houses
simple people, barren moors, heather-clad mountains, wild flowers, calm
lakes, plain, rugged simplicity

the world is too much with us; late and soon
getting and spending, we lay waste our powers
little we see in nature that is ours
we have given our hearts away, a sordid boon
this sea, that bares her bosom to the moon
the winds that will be howling at all hours
and are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers
for this, for everything, we are out of tune
it moves us not. great god! i'd rather be
a pagan, suckled in a creed outworn
so might i, standing on this pleasant lea
have glimpses that would make me less forlorn
have sight of proteus, rising from the sea
or hear old triton blow his wreathed horn



stately and pathetic sonnet in existence. the soul enduring enforced
idleness and loss of power without repining. inactivity made to serve a
higher end

there is no first or last

when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days, in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodg'd with me useless, though my soul more bent
to serve therewith my maker, and present
my true account, lest he, returning, chide
doth god exact day-labour, light denied
i fondly ask: but patience, to prevent
that murmur, soon replies, god doth not need
either man's work, or his own gifts; who best
bear his mild yoke, they serve him best; his state
is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed
and post o'er land and ocean without rest
they also serve who only stand and wait



included here because it is a picture of woman as she should be, not
made dainty by finery, but by fine ideals

for human nature's daily food

she was a phantom of delight
when first she gleamed upon my sight
a lovely apparition, sent
to be a moment's ornament
her eyes as stars of twilight fair
like twilight's, too, her dusky hair
but all things else about her drawn
from may-time and the cheerful dawn
a dancing shape, an image gay
to haunt, to startle, and waylay

i saw her upon nearer view
a spirit, yet a woman too
her household motions light and free
and steps of virgin liberty
a countenance in which did meet
sweet records, promises as sweet
a creature not too bright or good
for human nature's daily food
for transient sorrows, simple wiles
praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles

and now i see with eye serene
the very pulse of the machine
a being breathing thoughtful breath
a traveller between life and death
the reason firm, the temperate will
endurance, foresight, strength, and skill
a perfect woman, nobly planned
to warn, to comfort, and command
and yet a spirit still, and bright
with something of angelic light



from windsor castle through eton, down the long hedge-bound road which
passes the estate of william penn's descendants to stoke pogis, the
little churchyard where this poem was written. they were trimming a
great yew-tree under which gray was said to have written this poem. the
scene is one of peace and quiet. the "elegy" was a favourite form of
poem with the ancients, but gray is said to have reached the climax
among poets in this style of verse. the great line of the poem is


it would almost seem that poetry has for its greatest mission the
lesson of a proper humility

the curfew tolls the knell of parting day
the lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea
the plowman homeward plods his weary way
and leaves the world to darkness and to me

now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight
and all the air a solemn stillness holds
save where the beetle wheels his droning flight
and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds

save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r
the moping owl does to the moon complain
of such as, wandering near her secret bow'r
molest her ancient solitary reign

beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade
where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap
each in his narrow cell forever laid
the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep

the breezy call of incense-breathing morn
the swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed
the cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn
no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed

for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn
or busy housewife ply her evening care
no children run to lisp their sire's return
or climb his knees the envied kiss to share

oft did the harvest to their sickle yield
their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke
how jocund did they drive their team afield
how bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke

let not ambition mock their useful toil
their homely joys, and destiny obscure
nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
the short and simple annals of the poor

the boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r
and all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave
await alike th' inevitable hour
the paths of glory lead but to the grave

forgive, ye proud, th' involuntary fault
if memory to these no trophies raise
where thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
the pealing anthem swells the note of praise

can storied urn or animated bust
back to its mansion call the fleeting breath
can honour's voice provoke the silent dust
or flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death

perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
some heart once pregnant with celestial fire
hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd
or waked to ecstasy the living lyre

but knowledge to their eyes her ample page
rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll
chill penury repress'd their noble rage
and froze the genial current of the soul

full many a gem of purest ray serene
the dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear
full many a flower is born to blush unseen
and waste its sweetness on the desert air

some village-hampden, that with dauntless breast
the little tyrant of his fields withstood
some mute inglorious milton here may rest
some cromwell guiltless of his country's blood

th' applause of listening senates to command
the threats of pain and ruin to despise
to scatter plenty o'er a smiling land
and read their history in a nation's eyes

their lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone
their growing virtues, but their crimes confined
forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne
and shut the gates of mercy on mankind

the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide
to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame
or heap the shrine of luxury and pride
with incense, kindled at the muse's flame

far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife
their sober wishes never learn'd to stray
along the cool sequester'd vale of life
they kept the noiseless tenour of their way

yet e'en those bones from insult to protect
some frail memorial still erected nigh
with uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd
implores the passing tribute of a sigh

their name, their years, spelt by th' unlettered muse
the place of fame and elegy supply
and many a holy text around she strews
that teach the rustic moralist to die

for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey
this pleasing anxious being e'er resigned
left the warm precincts of the cheerful day
nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind

on some fond breast the parting soul relies
some pious drops the closing eye requires
e'en from the tomb the voice of nature cries
e'en in our ashes live their wonted fires

for thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead
dost in these lines their artless tale relate
if chance, by lonely contemplation led
some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate

haply some hoary-headed swain may say
brushing with hasty steps the dews away
to meet the sun upon the upland lawn

that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high
his listless length at noon-tide would he stretch
and pore upon the brook that babbles by

muttering his wayward fancies he would rove
now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn
or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love

along the heath, and near his favourite tree
another came; nor yet beside the rill
nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he

slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne
approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay
graved on the stone beneath yon agèd thorn


here rests his head upon the lap of earth
a youth to fortune and to fame unknown
fair science frown'd not on his humble birth
and melancholy mark'd him for her own

large was his bounty, and his soul sincere
heaven did a recompense as largely send
he gave to mis'ry all he had, a tear
he gain'd from heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend

no farther seek his merits to disclose
or draw his frailties from their dread abode
the bosom of his father and his god



and age for counsel; each year, each period of a man's life is but the
necessary step to the next. youth is an uncertain thing to bank on

the best is yet to be
the last of life for which the first was made

keynote


grow old along with me
the best is yet to be
the last of life, for which the first was made
our times are in his hand
who saith, "a whole i plann'd
youth shows but half; trust god: see all nor be afraid

not that, amassing flowers
youth sigh'd, "which rose make ours
which lily leave and then as best recall
not that, admiring stars
it yearn'd, "nor jove, nor mars
mine be some figured flame which blends, transcends them all

not for such hopes and fears
annulling youth's brief years
do i remonstrate: folly wide the mark
rather i prize the doubt
low kinds exist without
finish'd and finite clods, untroubled by a spark

poor vaunt of life indeed
were man but formed to feed
on joy, to solely seek and find and feast
such feasting ended, then
as sure an end to men
irks care the crop-full bird? frets doubt the maw-cramm'd beast

rejoice we are allied
to that which doth provide
and not partake, effect and not receive
a spark disturbs our clod
nearer we hold of god
who gives, than of his tribes that take, i must believe

then, welcome each rebuff
that turns earth's smoothness rough
each sting, that bids nor sit nor stand, but go
be our joys three parts pain
strive, and hold cheap the strain
learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe

for thence,--a paradox
which comforts while it mocks
shall life succeed in that it seems to fail
what i aspired to be
and was not, comforts me
a brute i might have been, but would not sink i' the scale

what is he but a brute
whose flesh has soul to suit
whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play
to man, propose this test
thy body at its best
how far can that project thy soul on its lone way

yet gifts should prove their use
i own the past profuse
of power each side, perfection every turn
eyes, ears took in their dole
brain treasured up the whole
should not the heart beat once "how good to live and learn

not once beat "praise be thine
i see the whole design
i, who saw power, see now love perfect too
perfect i call thy plan
thanks that i was a man
maker, remake, complete,--i trust what thou shalt do

for pleasant is this flesh
our soul, in its rose-mesh
pull'd ever to the earth, still yearns for rest
would we some prize might hold
to match those manifold
possessions of the brute,--gain most, as we did best

let us not always say
i strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole
as the bird wings and sings
let us cry, "all good things
are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul

therefore i summon age
to grant youth's heritage
life's struggle having so far reached its term
thence shall i pass, approved
a man, for aye removed
from the developed brute; a god though in the germ

and i shall thereupon
take rest, ere i be gone
once more on my adventure brave and new
fearless and unperplex'd
when i wage battle next
what weapons to select, what armour to indue

youth ended, i shall try
my gain or loss thereby
leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold
and i shall weigh the same
give life its praise or blame
young, all lay in dispute; i shall know, being old

for note, when evening shuts
a certain moment cuts
the deed off, calls the glory from the gray
a whisper from the west
shoots--"add this to the rest
take it and try its worth: here dies another day

so, still within this life
though lifted o'er its strife
let me discern, compare, pronounce at last
that acquiescence vain
the future i may face now i have proved the past

for more is not reserved
to man, with soul just nerved
to act to-morrow what he learns to-day
here, work enough to watch
the master work, and catch
hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play

as it was better, youth
should strive, through acts uncouth
toward making, than repose on aught found made
so, better, age, exempt
from strife, should know, than tempt
further. thou waitedest age: wait death nor be afraid

enough now, if the right
and good and infinite
be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own
with knowledge absolute
subject to no dispute
from fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone

be there, for once and all
sever'd great minds from small
announced to each his station in the past
was i, the world arraigned
were they, my soul disdain'd
right? let age speak the truth and give us peace at last

now, who shall arbitrate
ten men love what i hate
shun what i follow, slight what i receive
ten, who in ears and eyes
match me: we all surmise
they this thing, and i that: whom shall my soul believe

not on the vulgar mass
call'd "work," must sentence pass
things done, that took the eye and had the price
o'er which, from level stand
the low world laid its hand
found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice

but all, the world's coarse thumb
and finger fail'd to plumb
so pass'd in making up the main account
all instincts immature
all purposes unsure
that weigh'd not as his work, yet swell'd the man's amount

thoughts hardly to be pack'd
into a narrow act
fancies that broke through language and escaped
all i could never be
all, men ignored in me
this, i was worth to god, whose wheel the pitcher shaped

ay, note that potter's wheel
that metaphor! and feel
why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay
thou, to whom fools propound
when the wine makes its round

fool! all that is, at all
lasts ever, past recall
earth changes, but thy soul and god stand sure
what enter'd into thee
time's wheel runs back or stops: potter and clay endure

he fix'd thee 'mid this dance
of plastic circumstance
this present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest
machinery just meant
to give thy soul its bent
try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impress'd

what though the earlier grooves
which ran the laughing loves
around thy base, no longer pause and press
what though, about thy rim
scull-things in order grim
grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress

look not thou down but up
to uses of a cup
the festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal
the new wine's foaming flow
the master's lips aglow
thou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's wheel

but i need, now as then
thee, god, who mouldest men
and since, not even while the whirl was worst
did i,--to the wheel of life
with shapes and colours rife
bound dizzily,--mistake my end, to slake thy thirst

so, take and use thy work
amend what flaws may lurk
what strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim
my times be in thy hand
perfect the cup as plann'd
lest age approve of youth, and death complete the same



ever written. it is a battle-song and a pæan of victory

and the strong man must go
and bade me creep past

this poem is included in this book because these lines are enough to
reconcile any one to any fate

fear death?--to feel the fog in my throat
the mist in _my_ face
when the snows begin, and the blasts denote
i am nearing the place
the power of the night, the press of the storm
the post of the foe
where he stands, the arch fear in a visible form
yet the strong man must go
for the journey is done and the summit attained
and the barriers fall
though a battle's to fight ere a guerdon be gained
the reward of it all
i was ever a fighter, so--one fight more
the best and the last
i would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forebore
and bade me creep past
no! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers
the heroes of old
bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears
of pain, darkness, and cold
for sudden the worst turns the best to the brave
the black minute's at end
and the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that rave
shall dwindle, shall blend
shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain
then a light, then thy breast
o thou soul of my soul! i shall clasp thee again
and with god be the rest



the "recessional" (by rudyard kipling, 1865-) is one of the most
popular poems of this century. it is a warning to an age and a nation
drunk with power, a rebuke to materialistic tendencies and
boastfulness, a protest against pride


god of our fathers, known of old
lord of our far-flung battle-line
beneath whose awful hand we hold
dominion over palm and pine
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget

the tumult and the shouting dies
the captains and the kings depart
still stands thine ancient sacrifice
an humble and a contrite heart
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget

far-called our navies melt away
on dune and headland sinks the fire
lo, all our pomp of yesterday
is one with nineveh and tyre
judge of the nations, spare us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget

if, drunk with sight of power, we loose
wild tongues that have not thee in awe
such boasting as the gentiles use
or lesser breeds without the law
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget

for heathen heart that puts her trust
in reeking tube and iron shard
all valiant dust that builds on dust
and guarding calls not thee to guard
for frantic boast and foolish word
thy mercy on thy people, lord! amen



is a rebuke to the insolent pride of kings and empires. it is extremely
picturesque. it finds a place here because more elderly scholars of
good judgment are pleased with it. i remember an old gray-haired
scholar in chicago who often recited it to his friends merely because
it touched his fancy

i met a traveller from an antique land
who said: "two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert. near them on the sand
half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things
the hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed
and on the pedestal these words appear
look on my works, ye mighty, and despair
nothing beside remains. round the decay
of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
the lone and level sands stretch far away



favourite poem

o why should the spirit of mortal be proud
like a fast-flitting meteor, a fast-flying cloud
a flash of the lightning, a break of the wave
he passes from life to his rest in the grave

the leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade
be scattered around and together be laid
and the young and the old, and the low and the high
shall moulder to dust and together shall lie

the child that a mother attended and loved
the mother that infant's affection that proved
the husband that mother and infant that blessed
each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest

the maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye
shone beauty and pleasure,--her triumphs are by
and the memory of those that beloved her and praised
are alike from the minds of the living erased

the hand of the king that the scepter hath borne
the brow of the priest that the miter hath worn
the eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave
are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave

the peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap
the herdsman who climbed with his goats to the steep
the beggar that wandered in search of his bread
have faded away like the grass that we tread

the saint that enjoyed the communion of heaven
the sinner that dared to remain unforgiven
the wise and the foolish, the guilty and just
have quietly mingled their bones in the dust

so the multitude goes, like the flower and the weed
that wither away to let others succeed
so the multitude comes, even those we behold
to repeat every tale that hath often been told

for we are the same that our fathers have been
we see the same sights that our fathers have seen
we drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun
and we run the same course that our fathers have run

the thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would think
from the death we are shrinking from, they too would shrink
to the life we are clinging to, they too would cling
but it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing

they loved, but their story we cannot unfold
they scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold
they grieved, but no wail from their slumbers may come
they enjoyed, but the voice of their gladness is dumb

they died, ay! they died! and we things that are now
who walk on the turf that lies over their brow
who make in their dwellings a transient abode
meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road

yea! hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain
are mingled together like sunshine and rain
and the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge
still follow each other, like surge upon surge

from the blossom of health to the paleness of death
from the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud
o why should the spirit of mortal be proud



the last four lines of this sonnet form the most tremendous climax in
literature. the picture is as vivid as if done with a brush. every
great book, every great poem is a new world, an undiscovered country
every learned person is a whole territory, a universe of new thought
every one who does anything with a heart for it, every specialist every
one, however simple, who is strenuous and genuine, is a "new
discovery." let us give credit to the smallest planet that is true to
its own orbit

much have i travelled in the realms of gold
and many goodly states and kingdoms seen
round many western islands have i been
which bards in fealty to apollo hold

oft of one wide expanse had i been told
that deep-brow'd homer ruled as his demesne
yet did i never breathe its pure serene
till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold

then felt i like some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken
or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes

he stared at the pacific--and all his men
look'd at each other with a wild surmise
silent, upon a peak in darien



here is a hero who does a great deed simply as a part of his day's
work. he puts no value on what he has done, because he could have done
no other way

on the sea and at the hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two
did the english fight the french--woe to france
and, the thirty-first of may, helter-skelter through the blue
like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue
came crowding ship on ship to st. malo on the rance
with the english fleet in view

first and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, damfreville
close on him fled, great and small
twenty-two good ships in all
and they signalled to the place
get us guidance, give us harbour, take us quick--or, quicker still
here's the english can and will

then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leaped on board
laughed they
and scored
shall the _formidable_ here, with her twelve and eighty guns
think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way
trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons
and with flow at full beside
now 'tis slackest ebb of tide
reach the mooring! rather say
while rock stands or water runs
not a ship will leave the bay

then was called a council straight
brief and bitter the debate
all that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow
for a prize to plymouth sound
better run the ships aground
let the captains all and each
shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach
france must undergo her fate

was ever spoke or heard
for up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these
a captain? a lieutenant? a mate--first, second, third
no such man of mark, and meet
with his betters to compete
but a simple breton sailor pressed by tourville for the fleet
a poor coasting pilot he, hervé riel, the croisiekese

and "what mockery or malice have we here?" cries hervé riel
talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell
on my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell
are you bought by english gold? is it love the lying's for
morn and eve, night and day
have i piloted your bay
entered free and anchored fast at the foot of solidor
burn the fleet and ruin france? that were worse than fifty hogues
sirs, they know i speak the truth! sirs, believe me there's a way
only let me lead the line
have the biggest ship to steer
get this _formidable_ clear
make the others follow mine
and i lead them, most and least, by a passage i know well
right to solidor past grève
and there lay them safe and sound
and if one ship misbehave
why, i've nothing but my life,--here's my head!" cries hervé riel

not a minute more to wait
take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!" cried its chief
captains, give the sailor place
he is admiral, in brief
still the north wind, by god's grace
see the noble fellow's face
as the big ship, with a bound
clears the entry like a hound
keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound
see, safe through shoal and rock
how they follow in a flock
not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground
not a spar that comes to grief
the peril, see, is past
all are harboured to the last
and just as hervé riel hollas "anchor!"--sure as fate
up the english come--too late

so, the storm subsides to calm
they see the green trees wave
on the heights o'erlooking grève
hearts that bled are stanched with balm
let the english rake the bay
gnash their teeth and glare askance
as they cannonade away
how hope succeeds despair on each captain's countenance
out burst all with one accord
let france, let france's king
thank the man that did the thing
what a shout, and all one word
as he stepped in front once more
not a symptom of surprise
in the frank blue breton eyes
just the same man as before

then said damfreville, "my friend
i must speak out at the end
though i find the speaking hard
praise is deeper than the lips
you have saved the king his ships
you must name your own reward
demand whate'er you will
france remains your debtor still
ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not damfreville

then a beam of fun outbroke
on the bearded mouth that spoke
as the honest heart laughed through
those frank eyes of breton blue
since on board the duty's done
and from malo roads to croisic point, what is it but a run
since 'tis ask and have, i may
since the others go ashore
come! a good whole holiday
leave to go and see my wife, whom i call the belle aurore
that he asked and that he got,--nothing more

name and deed alike are lost
not a pillar nor a post
in his croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell
not a head in white and black
on a single fishing smack
in memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
all that france saved from the fight whence england bore the bell
go to paris: rank on rank
search the heroes flung pell-mell
on the louvre, face and flank
you shall look long enough ere you come to hervé riel
so, for better and for worse
hervé riel, accept my verse
in my verse, hervé riel, do thou once more
save the squadron, honour france, love thy wife the belle aurore



of the world to the other. emerson teaches one lesson above all others
that each soul must work out for itself its latent force, its own
individual expression, and that with a "sad sincerity." "the bishop of
the soul" can do no more

i like a church; i like a cowl
i love a prophet of the soul
and on my heart monastic aisles
fall like sweet strains, or pensive smiles
yet not for all his faith can see
would i that cowlèd churchman be
why should the vest on him allure
which i could not on me endure

not from a vain or shallow thought
his awful jove young phidias brought
never from lips of cunning fell
the thrilling delphic oracle
out from the heart of nature rolled
the burdens of the bible old
the litanies of nations came
like the volcano's tongue of flame
up from the burning core below
the canticles of love and woe
the hand that rounded peter's dome
and groined the aisles of christian rome
wrought in a sad sincerity
himself from god he could not free
he builded better than he knew
the conscious stone to beauty grew

knowst thou what wove yon woodbird's nest
of leaves and feathers from her breast
or how the fish outbuilt her shell
painting with morn each annual cell
or how the sacred pine-tree adds
to her old leaves new myriads
such and so grew these holy piles
while love and terror laid the tiles
earth proudly wears the parthenon
as the best gem upon her zone
and morning opes with haste her lids
to gaze upon the pyramids
o'er england's abbeys bends the sky
as on its friends, with kindred eye
for out of thought's interior sphere
these wonders rose to upper air
and nature gladly gave them place
adopted them into her race
and granted them an equal date
with andes and with ararat

these temples grew as grows the grass
art might obey, but not surpass
the passive master lent his hand
to the vast soul that o'er him planned
and the same power that reared the shrine
bestrode the tribes that knelt within
ever the fiery pentecost
girds with one flame the countless host
trances the heart through chanting choirs
and through the priest the mind inspires
the word unto the prophet spoken
was writ on tables yet unbroken
the word by seers or sibyls told
in groves of oak, or fanes of gold
still floats upon the morning wind
still whispers to the willing mind
one accent of the holy ghost
the heedless world hath never lost
i know what say the fathers wise
the book itself before me lies
old chrysostom, best augustine
and he who blent both in his line
the younger golden lips or mines
taylor, the shakespeare of divines
his words are music in my ear
i see his cowlèd portrait dear
and yet, for all his faith could see
i would not the good bishop be



poem and a great poem. it is a keen thrust at the common practice of
teaching american children to hate the english of these days on account
of the actions of a silly old king dead a hundred years. alfred austin
deserves great credit for this poem

what is the voice i hear
on the winds of the western sea
sentinel, listen from out cape clear
and say what the voice may be

and it says to them: "kinsmen, hail
we severed have been too long
now let us have done with a worn-out tale
the tale of an ancient wrong
and our friendship last long as our love doth and be stronger
than death is strong

answer them, sons of the self-same race
and blood of the self-same clan
let us speak with each other face to face
and answer as man to man
and loyally love and trust each other as none but free men can

now fling them out to the breeze
shamrock, thistle, and rose
and the star-spangled banner unfurl with these
a message to friends and foes
wherever the sails of peace are seen and wherever the war-wind blows

a message to bond and thrall to wake
for wherever we come, we twain
the throne of the tyrant shall rock and quake
and his menace be void and vain
for you are lords of a strong land and we are lords of the main

yes, this is the voice of the bluff march gale
we severed have been too long
but now we have done with a worn-out tale
the tale of an ancient wrong
and our friendship last long as love doth last and stronger
than death is strong



it is quite true that the english flag stands for freedom the world
over. wherever it floats almost any one is safe, whether english or

some time, but ultimately when it fell the crowds rent the air with
shouts, and seemed to see significance in the incident.--_daily
papers

winds of the world, give answer? they are whimpering to and fro
and what should they know of england who only england know
the poor little street-bred people that vapour and fume and brag
they are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at
the english flag

must we borrow a clout from the boer--to plaster anew with dirt
an irish liar's bandage, or an english coward's shirt
we may not speak of england; her flag's to sell or share
what is the flag of england? winds of the world, declare

the north wind blew:--"from bergen my steel-shod van-guards go
i chase your lazy whalers home from the disko floe
by the great north lights above me i work the will of god
that the liner splits on the ice-field or the dogger fills with cod

because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came
i took the sun from their presence, i cut them down with my blast
and they died, but the flag of england blew free ere the spirit passed

the musk-ox knows the standard that flouts the northern light
what is the flag of england? ye have but my bergs to dare
ye have but my drifts to conquer. go forth, for it is there

the south wind sighed:--"from the virgins my mid-sea course was ta'en
over a thousand islands lost in an idle main
where the sea-egg flames on the coral and the long-backed
breakers croon
their endless ocean legends to the lazy, locked lagoon

i waked the palms to laughter--i tossed the scud in the breeze
never was isle so little, never was sea so lone
but over the scud and the palm-trees an english flag was flown

on the horn
i have chased it north to the lizard--ribboned and rolled and torn
i have spread its fold o'er the dying, adrift in a hopeless sea
i have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the slave set free

where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the southern cross
what is the flag of england? ye have but my reefs to dare
ye have but my seas to furrow. go forth, for it is there

the east wind roared:--"from the kuriles, the bitter seas, i come
and me men call the home-wind, for i bring the english home
look--look well to your shipping! by the breath of my mad typhoon
i swept your close-packed praya and beached your best at kowloon

i raped your richest roadstead--i plundered singapore
i set my hand on the hoogli; as a hooded snake she rose
and i flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows

but a soul goes out on the east wind that died for england's sake
man or woman or suckling, mother or bride or maid
because on the bones of the english the english flag is stayed

the scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows
what is the flag of england? ye have but my sun to dare
ye have but my sands to travel. go forth, for it is there

the west wind called:--"in squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly
that bear the wheat and cattle lest street-bred people die
they make my might their porter, they make my house their path
till i loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath

they bellow one to the other, the frightened ship-bells toll
for day is a drifting terror till i raise the shroud with my breath
and they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death

i heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away
first of the scattered legions, under a shrieking sky
dipping between the rollers, the english flag goes by

the naked stars have seen it, a fellow-star in the mist
what is the flag of england? ye have but my breath to dare
ye have but my waves to conquer. go forth, for it is there



american ought to be proud of it, for we want no such type allowed to
be developed in this country as the low-browed peasant of france. this
poem is a stroke of genius. the story goes that it so offended a modern
plutocrat that he offered a reward of $10,000 to any one who could
write an equally good poem in rebuttal. "the man with the hoe" has won
for edwin markham the title of "poet laureate of the labouring
classes


god made man in his own image, in the image of god made he

bowed by the weight of centuries he leans
upon his hoe and gazes on the ground
the emptiness of ages in his face
and on his back the burden of the world
who made him dead to rapture and despair
a thing that grieves not and that never hopes
stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox
who loosened and let down this brutal jaw
whose was the hand that slanted back this brow
whose breath blew out the light within this brain

is this the thing the lord god made and gave
to have dominion over sea and land
to trace the stars and search the heavens for power
to feel the passion of eternity
is this the dream he dreamed who shaped the suns
and marked their ways upon the ancient deep
down all the stretch of hell to its last gulf
there is no shape more terrible than this
more tongued with censure of the world's blind greed
more filled with signs and portents for the soul
more fraught with menace to the universe

what gulfs between him and the seraphim
slave of the wheel of labour, what to him
are plato and the swing of pleiades
what the long reaches of the peaks of song
the rift of dawn, the reddening of the rose
through this dread shape the suffering ages look
time's tragedy is in that aching stoop
through this dread shape humanity betrayed
plundered, profaned, and disinherited
cries protest to the judges of the world
a protest that is also prophecy

o masters, lords, and rulers in all lands
is this the handiwork you give to god
this monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched
how will you ever straighten up this shape
touch it again with immortality
give back the upward looking and the light
rebuild in it the music and the dream
make right the immemorial infamies
perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes

o masters, lords, and rulers in all lands
how will the future reckon with this man
how answer his brute question in that hour
when whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world
how will it be with kingdoms and with kings
with those who shaped him to the thing he is
when this dumb terror shall reply to god
after the silence of the centuries



characteristic poems. i love the swing and the stride of his great long
lines. i love his rough-shod way of trampling down and kicking out of
the way the conventionalities that spring up like poisonous mushrooms
to make the world a vast labyrinth of petty "proprieties" until
everything is nasty. i love the oxygen he pours on the world. i love
his genius for brotherliness, his picture of the negro with rolling
eyes and the firelock in the corner. these excerpts are some of his
best lines

i celebrate myself, and sing myself
and what i assume you shall assume
for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you
i loafe and invite my soul
i lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass
my tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air
born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their
parents the same
i, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin
hoping to cease not till death

i harbor for good or bad, i permit to speak at every hazard
nature without check with original energy

have you reckoned a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the
earth much
have you practised so long to learn to read
have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems

stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin
of all poems
you shall possess the good of the earth and sun (there are
millions of suns left
you shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look
through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the specters in books
you shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me
you shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself

a child said, "_what is the grass?_" fetching it to me with full hands
how could i answer the child? i do not know what it is any more
than he
i guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green
stuff woven
or, i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord
a scented gift and remembrance designedly dropt
bearing the owner's name some way in the corners
that we may see and remark, and say

alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt
wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee
in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night
kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game
falling asleep on the gathered leaves with my dog and gun by my side
the yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle
and scud
my eyes settle the land, i bend at her prow or shout joyously from
the deck
the boatman and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me
i tucked my trouser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time
you should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle

the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside
i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile
through the swung half-door of the kitchen i saw him limpsy and weak
and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him
and brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and
bruis'd feet
and gave him a room that entered from my own, and gave him some
coarse clean clothes
and remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness
and remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles
he staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passed north
i had him sit next me at table, my firelock lean'd in the corner

i am the poet of the woman the same as the man
and i say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man
and i say there is nothing greater than the mother of men

i understand the large hearts of heroes
the courage of present times and all times
how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship
and death chasing it up and down the storm
how he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful of
days and faithful of nights
and chalked in large letters on a board, "_be of good cheer, we will
not desert you
how he followed with them and tack'd with them three days and would
not give it up
how he saved the drifting company at last
how the lank loose-gown'd women looked when boated from the side
of their prepared graves
how the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the
sharp-lipp'd unshaved men
all this i swallow, it tastes good, i like it well, it becomes mine
i am the man, i suffered, i was there
the disdain and calmness of martyrs
the mother of old, condemned for a witch, burned with dry wood, her
children gazing on
the hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence blowing
covered with sweat
i am the hounded slave, i wince at the bite of the dogs
hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen
i clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the
ooze of my skin
i fall on the weeds and stones
the riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close
taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with
whip-stocks

old age superbly rising! o welcome, ineffable grace of dying days

see ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that
count ever so much, there is limitless time around that
my rendezvous is appointed, it is certain
the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms
the great camerado, the lover true for whom i pine will be there

and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own
funeral drest in his shroud

and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds
the learning of all times
and there is no trade or employment but the young man following
it may become a hero
and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd
universe
and i say to any man or woman, "let your soul stand cool and composed
before a million universes

i see something of god each hour of the twenty-four, and each
moment then
in the faces of men and women i see god, and in my own face in
the glass
i find letters from god dropt in the street, and every one is
sign'd by god's name
and i leave them where they are, for i know that wheresoe'er i go
others will punctually come forever and ever

listener up there! what have you to confide in me
look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening
longer
who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with
his supper
who wishes to walk with me

i too am not a bit tamed, i too am untranslatable
i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world


when silence flees before the voice of love
of what expression does that god approve
is dulcet song or flowing verse his choice
or stately prose, made regal by his voice
speaks love in couplets, or in epics grand
and is love humble, or does he command

there is no language that love does not speak
to-day commanding and to-morrow meek
one hour laconic and the next verbose
with hope triumphant and with doubt morose
his varying moods all forms of speech employ
to give expression to his painful joy

to voice the phases of his joyful pain
he rings the changes on the poet’s strain
yet not in epic, epigram or verse
can love the passion of his heart rehearse
all speech, all language, is inadequate
there are no words with love commensurate


between the little here and larger yonder
there is a realm (or so one day i read
where faithful spirits love-enchained may wander
till some remembering soul from earth has fled
then, reunited, they go forth afar
from sphere to sphere, where wondrous angels are

not many spirits in that realm are waiting
not many pause upon its shores to rest
for only love, intense and unabating
can hold them from the longer, higher quest
and after grief has wept itself to sleep
few hearts on earth their vital memories keep

should i pass on, across the mystic border
let thy love link me to that pallid land
i would not seek the heavens of finer order
until thy barque had left this coarser strand
how desolate such journeyings would be
though straight to him, were they not shared by thee

wert thou first called (dear god, how could i bear it
i should enchain thee with my love, i know
not great enough am i to free thy spirit
from all these tender ties, and bid thee go
nor would a soul, unselfish as thine own
forget so soon, and speed to heaven alone

on earth we find no joy in ways diverging
how could we find it in the worlds unseen
i know old memories from my bosom surging
would keep thee waiting in that land between
until together, side by side, we trod
a path of stars, in our great search for god


midway upon the route, he paused athirst
and suddenly across the wastes of heat
he saw cool waters gleaming, and a sweet
green oasis upon his vision burst
a tender dream, long in his bosom nursed
spread love’s illusive verdure for his feet
the barren sands changed into golden wheat
the way grew glad that late had seemed accursed

she shone, the woman wonder, on his soul
the garden spot, for which men toil and wait
the house of rest, that is each heart’s demand
but when, at last, he reached the gleaming goal
he found, oh, cruel irony of fate
but desert sun upon the desert sand


i know the need of the world
though it would not have me know
it would hide its sorrow deep
where only god may go
yet its secret it can not keep
it tells it awake, or asleep
it tells it to all who will heed
and he who runs may read
the need of the world i know

i know the need of the world
when it boasts of its wealth the loudest
when it flaunts it in all men’s eyes
when its mien is the gayest and proudest
oh! ever it lies—it lies
for the sound of its laughter dies
in a sob and a smothered moan
and it weeps when it sits alone
the need of the world i know

i know the need of the world
when the earth shakes under the tread
of men who march to the fight
when rivers with blood are red
and there is no law but might
and the wrong way seems the right
when he who slaughters the most
is all men’s pride and boast
the need of the world i know

i know the need of the world
when it babbles of gold and fame
it is only to lead us astray
from the thing that it dare not name
for this is the sad world’s way
oh! poor blind world grown grey
with the need of a thing so near
with the want of a thing so dear
the need of the world i know

the need of the world is love
deep under the pride of power
down under its lust of greed
for the joys that last but an hour
there lies forever its need
for love is the law and the creed
and love is the unnamed goal
of life, from man to the mole
love is the need of the world


skilled mariner, and counted sane and wise
that was a curious thing which chanced to me
so good a sailor on so fair a sea
with favouring winds and blue unshadowed skies
led by the faithful beacon of love’s eyes
past reef and shoal, my life-boat bounded free
and fearless of all changes that might be
under calm waves, where many a sunk rock lies

a golden dawn; yet suddenly my barque
strained at the sails, as in a cyclone’s blast
and battled with an unseen current’s force
for we had entered when the night was dark
that old tempestuous gulf stream of the past
but for love’s eyes, i had not kept the course


his art was loving; eres set his sign
upon that youthful forehead, and he drew
the hearts of women, as the sun draws dew
love feeds love’s thirst as wine feeds love of wine
nor is there any potion from the vine
which makes men drunken like the subtle brew
of kisses crushed by kisses; and he grew
inebriated with that draught divine

yet in his sober moments, when the sun
of radiant summer paled to lonely fall
and passion’s sea had grown an ebbing tide
from out the many, memory singled one
full cup that seemed the sweetest of them all—



the world an abject vassal to her charms
and kings competing for a single smile
yet love she knew not, till upon this isle
she gave surrender to abducting arms
not theseus, who plucked her lips’ first kiss
not menelaus, lawful mate and spouse
such answering passion in her heart could rouse
or wake such tumult in her soul as this
let come what will, let greece and asia meet
let heroes die and kingdoms run with gore
let devastation spread from shore to shore—
resplendent helen finds her bondage sweet
the whole world fights her battles, while she lies
sunned in the fervour of young paris’ eyes


the battles ended, ardent paris dead
of faithful menelaus long bereft
time is the only suitor who is left
helen survives, with youth and beauty fled
by hate remembered, but by love forgot
dethroned and driven from her high estate
unhappy helen feels the lash of fate
and knows at last an unloved woman’s lot
the grecian marvel, and the trojan joy
the world’s fair wonder, from her palace flies
the furies follow, and great helen dies
a death of horror, for the pride of troy

helen, immortal in her beauty, lives


lais when young, and all her charms in flower
lais, whose beauty was the fateful light
that led great ships to anchor in the night
and bring their priceless cargoes to her bower
lais yet found her cup of sweet turned sour
great plato’s pupil, from his lofty height
zenocrates, unmoved, had seen the white
sweet wonder of her, and defied her power

she snared the world in nets of subtle wiles
the proud, the famed, all clamoured at her gate
dictators plead, inside her portico
wisdom sought madness, in her favouring smiles
now was she made the laughing-stock of fate
one loosed her clinging arms, and bade her go


lais, when old and all her beauty gone
lais, the erstwhile courted pleasure queen
walked homeless through corinth
one mocked her mien—
one tossed her coins; she took them and passed on
down by the harbour sloped a terraced lawn
where fountains played; she paused to view the scene
a marble palace stood in bowers of green
’twas here of old she revelled till the dawn

through yonder portico her lovers came—
hero and statesman, athlete, merchant, sage
they flung the whole world’s treasures at her feet
to buy her favour and exalt her shame

and faded like a phantom down the street


you are here, and you are wanted
though a waif upon life’s stair
though the sunlit hours are haunted
with the shadowy shapes of care
still the great one, the all-seeing
called your spirit into being—
gave you strength for any fate
since your life by him was needed
all your ways by him are heeded—
you can trust and you can wait

you can wait to know the meaning
of the troubles sent your soul
of the chasms intervening
’twixt your purpose and your goal
of the sorrows and the trials
of the silence and denials
ofttimes answering to your pleas
of the stinted sweets of pleasure
and of pain’s too generous measure—
you can wait the _why_ of these

forth from planet unto planet
you have gone, and you will go
space is vast, but we must span it
for life’s purpose is _to know
earth retains you but a minute
make the best of what lies in it
light the pathway where you are
there is nothing worth the doing
that will leave regret or rueing
as you speed from star to star

you are part of the beginning
you are parcel of to-day
when he set his world to spinning
you were flung upon your way
when the system falls to pieces
when this pulsing epoch ceases
when the _is_ becomes the _was
you will live, for you will enter
in the great creative centre
in the all-enduring cause



sailing away on a summer sea
out of the bleak march weather
drifting away for a loaf and play
just you and i together
and it’s good-bye worry and good-bye hurry
and never a care have we
with the sea below and the sun above
and nothing to do but dream and love
sailing away together

sailing away from the grim old town
and tasks the town calls duty
sailing away from walls of grey
to a land of bloom and beauty
and it’s good-bye to letters from our lessers and our betters
to the cold world’s smile or its frown
we sail away on a sunny track
to find the summer and bring it back
and love is our only duty


afloat on a sea of passion
without a compass or chart
but the glow of your eye shows the sun is high
by the sextant of my heart
i know we are nearing the tropics
by the languor that round us lies
and the smile on your mouth says the course is south
and the port is paradise

we have left grey skies behind us
we sail under skies of blue
you are off with me on lovers’ sea
and i am away with you
we have not a single sorrow
and i have but one fear—
that my lips may miss one offered kiss
from the mouth that is smiling near

there is no land of winter
there is no world of care
there is bloom and mirth all over the earth
and love, love everywhere
our boat is the barque of pleasure
and whatever port we sight
the touch of your hand will make the land
the harbour of pure delight



i wrenched from a passing comet in its flight
by that great force of two mad hearts aflame
a soul incarnate, back to earth you came
to glow like star-dust for a little night
deep shadows hide you wholly from our sight
the centuries leave nothing but your name
tinged with the lustre of a splendid shame
that blazed oblivion with rebellious light

the mighty passion that became your cause
still burns its lengthening path across the years
we feel its raptures, and we see its tears
and ponder on its retributive laws
time keeps that deathless story ever new
yet finds no answer, when we ask of you


at argenteuil, i saw the lonely cell
where heloise dreamed through her broken rest
that baby lips pulled at her undried breast
it needed but my woman’s heart to tell
of those long vigils and the tears that fell
when aching arms reached out in fruitless quest
as after flight, wings brood an empty nest

across the centuries there comes no sound
of that vast anguish; not one sigh or word
or echo of the mother loss has stirred
the sea of silence, lasting and profound
yet to each heart, that once has felt this grief
sad memory restores time’s missing leaf


but what of you?  who took the mother’s place
when sweet expanding love its object sought
was there a voice to tell her tragic lot
and did you ever look upon her face
was yours a cloistered seeking after grace
or in the flame of adolescent thought
were abelard’s departed passions caught
to burn again in you and leave their trace

conceived in nature’s bold primordial way
you came to earth, a soul immaculate
baptized in fire, with some great part to play
what was that part, and wherefore hid from us
immortal mystery, astrolabius


when i shall meet god’s generous dispensers
of all the riches in the heavenly store
those lesser gods, who act as recompensers
for loneliness and loss upon this shore
methinks abashed, and somewhat hesitating
my soul its wish and longing will declare
lest they reply: ‘here are no bounties waiting
we gave on earth, your portion and your share.’

then shall i answer: ‘yea, i do remember
the many blessings to my life allowed
my june was always longer than december
my sun was always stronger than my cloud
my joy was ever deeper than my sorrow
my gain was ever greater than my loss
my yesterday seemed less than my to-morrow
the crown looked always larger than the cross

‘i have known love, in all its radiant splendour
it shone upon my pathway to the end
i trod no road that did not bloom with tender
and fragrant blossoms, planted by some friend
and those material things we call successes
in modest measure, crowned my earthly lot
yet was there one sweet happiness that blesses
the life of woman, which to me came not

‘i knew the hope of motherhood; a season
i felt a fluttering heart beat ’neath my own
a little cry—then silence.  for that reason
i dare, to you, my only wish make known
the babe who grew to angelhood in heaven
i never watched unfold from child to man
and so i ask, that unto me be given
that motherhood, which was god’s primal plan

‘all womankind he meant to share its glories
he meant us all to nurse our babes to rest
to croon them songs, to tell them sleepy stories
else why the wonder of a woman’s breast
he must provide for all earth’s cheated mothers
in his vast heavens of shining sphere on sphere
and with my son, there must be many others—
my spirit children who will claim me here

‘fair creatures by my loving thoughts created—
too finely fashioned for a mortal birth—
between the borders of two worlds they waited
until they saw my spirit leave the earth
in god’s great nursery they must be waiting
to welcome me with many an infant wile
now let me go and satisfy this longing
to mother children for a little while.’


as the grey twilight, tiptoed down the deep
and shadowy valley, to the day’s dark end
she whom i thought my ever-faithful friend
fair-browed, calm-eyed and mother-bosomed sleep
met me with smiles.  ‘poor longing heart, i keep
sweet joy for you,’ she murmured.  ‘i will send
one whom you love, with your own soul to blend
in visions, as the night hours onward creep.’

i trusted her; and watched by starry beams
i slumbered soundly, free from all alarms
then not my love, but one long banished came
led by false sleep, down secret stairs of dreams
and clasped me, unresisting in fond arms
oh, treacherous sleep—to sell me to such shame


meditating


now have i fully fixed upon my part
good-bye to dreams; for me a life of art
beloved art!  oh, realm serene and fair
above the mean and sordid world of care
above earth’s small ambitions and desires
art! art! the very word my soul inspires
from foolish memories it sets me free
not what has been, but that which is to be
absorbs me now.  adieu to vain regret
the bow is tensely drawn—the target set


maid (_aside

the night is dark and chill; the hour is late


who knocks upon my door


’tis i, your fate


thou dost deceive, not me, but thine own self
my fate is not a wandering, vagrant elf
my fate is here, within this throbbing heart
that beats alone for glory, and for art



pray, let me in; i am so faint and cold

outstretched hands

maid (_indignantly

methinks thou art not faint, however cold
but rather too courageous, and most bold
surprisingly ill-mannered, sir, and rude
without an invitation to intrude
into my very presence

cupid (_warming his hands

but, you see
girls never mind a little chap like me
they’re always watching for me on the sly
and hoping i will call

maid (_haughtily

my heart has listened to a sweeter voice
a clarion call that gives command—not choice
and i have answered to that call, ‘i come’
to other voices shall my ears be dumb
to art alone i consecrate my life—
art is my spouse, and i his willing wife

cupid (_slowly_, _gazing in the grate

art is a sultan, and you must divide
his love with many another ill-fed bride
now i know one who worships you alone

maid (_impatiently

i will not listen! for the dice is thrown
and art has won me.  on my brow some day
shall rest the laurel wreath—

cupid (_sitting down and looking at_ maid _critically

just let me say
i think sweet orange blossoms under lace
are better suited to your type of face

maid (_ignoring interruption

i yet shall stand before an audience
that listens as one mind, absorbed, intense
and with my genius i shall rouse its cheers
still it to silence, soften it to tears
or wake its laughter.  oh, the play! the play
the play’s the thing!  my boy, _the play

cupid (_suddenly clapping his hands

oh, say
i know a splendid role for you to take
and one that always keeps the house awake—
and calls for pretty dressing.  oh, it’s great

maid (_excitedly

well, well, what is it?  wherefore make me wait

cupid (_tapping his brow_, _thoughtfully

how is it those lines run—oh, now i know
you make a stately entrance—measured—slow—
to stirring music, then you kneel and say
something about—to honour and obey—
for better and for worse—till death do part

maid (_angrily

be still, you foolish boy; that is not _art

cupid (_seriously

she needs great skill who takes the role of wife
in god’s stupendous drama human life

maid (_suddenly becoming serious

so i once thought!  oh, once my very soul
was filled and thrilled with dreaming of that role
life seemed so wonderful; it held for me
no purpose, no ambition, but to be
loving and loved.  my highest thought of fame
was some day bearing my dear lover’s name
alone, i ofttimes uttered it aloud
or wrote it down, half timid, and all proud
to see myself lost utterly in him
as some small star might joy in growing dim
when sinking in the sun; or as the dew
forgetting the brief little life it knew
in space, might on the ocean’s bosom fall
and ask for nothing—only to give all

cupid (_aside

now, _that’s_ the talk—it’s music to my ear
after that stuff on ‘art’ and a ‘career.’
i hope she’ll keep it up

maiden (_continuing her reverie

again my dream
shaped into changing pictures.  i would seem
to see myself in beautiful array
move down the aisle upon my wedding day
and then i saw the modest living-room
with lighted lamp, and fragrant plants in bloom
and books and sewing scattered all about
and just we two alone

cupid (_in glee aside

there’s not a doubt
i’ll land her yet


my dream kaleidoscope
changed still again, and framed love’s dearest hope—
the trinity of home; and life was good
and all its deepest meaning understood

‘_beautiful land of nod_.’  cupid _in ecstasy tiptoes about and clasps
his hands in delight

another scene! a matron in her prime
i saw myself glide peacefully with time
into the quiet middle years, content
with simple joys the dear home circle lent
my sons and daughters made my diadem
i saw my happy youth renewed in them
the pain of growing old lost all its sting
for love stood near—in winter, as in spring

dramatically

’twas but a dream!  i woke all suddenly
the world had changed!  and now life means to me
my art—the stage—excitement and the crowd—
the glare of many foot-lights—and the loud
applause of men, as i cry in rage
‘give me the dagger!’ or creep down the stage
in that sleep-walking scene.  oh, art like mine
will send the chills down every listener’s spine
and when i choose, salt tears shall freely flow
as in the moonlight i cry, ‘romeo!  romeo
oh, wherefore art thou, romeo?’
ay, ’tis done
my dream of home life


it is but begun


the heart but once can dream a dream so fair
and so henceforth love thoughts i do forswear
since faith in love has crumbled to the dust
in fame alone, i put my hope and trust



here’s one who will explain yourself to you
and make that old sweet dream of love come true
fix up your foolish quarrel; time is brief—
so waste no more of it in doubt or grief


cupid (_in doorway

warm lip to lip, and heart to beating heart
the cast is made—my lady has her part




is this the way to greet thy loving spouse
but now returned from scenes of blood and strife
i pray thee raise thy veil and let me gaze
upon that beauty which hath greater power
to conquer me than all the arts of war


my beauty!  ay, my _beauty_!  i do hold
in thy regard, no more an honoured place
than yonder marble pillar, or the gold
and jewelled wine-cup which thy lips caress
thou wouldst degrade me in the people’s sight


degrade thee, vashti?  rather do i seek
to show my people who are gathered here
how, as the consort of so fair a queen
i feel more pride than as the mighty king
for there be many rulers on the earth
but only _one_ such queen.  come, raise thy veil


ay! only _one_ such queen!  a queen is one
who shares her husband’s greatness and his throne
i am no more than yonder dancing girl
who struts and smirks before a royal court
but i will loose my veil and loose my tongue
now listen, sire—my master and my king
and let thy princes and the court give ear
’tis time all heard how vashti feels her shame


shame is no word to couple with thy name
shame and a spotless woman may not meet
even in a sentence.  choose another word


ay, _shame_, my lord—there is no synonym
that can give voice to my ignoble state
to be a thing for eyes to gaze upon
yet held an outcast from thy heart and mind
to hear my beauty praised but not my worth
to come and go at pleasure’s beck and call
while barred from wisdom’s conclaves!  think ye _that
a noble calling for a noble dame
why, any concubine amongst thy train
could play my royal part as well as i—
were she as fair


queen vashti, art thou _mad
i would behead another did he dare
to so besmirch thee with comparison

vashti (_to the court

gaze now your fill!  behold queen vashti’s eyes
how large they gleam beneath her inch of brow
how like a great white star, her splendid face
shines through the midnight forest of her hair
and see the crushed pomegranate of her mouth
observe her arms, her throat, her gleaming breasts
whereon the royal jewels rise and fall!—
and note the crescent curving of her hips
and lovely limbs suggested ’neath her robes
gaze, gaze, i say, for these have made her queen
she hath no mind, no heart, no dignity
worth royal recognition and regard
but her fair body approbation meets
and whets the sated appetite of kings
now ye have seen what she was bid to show
the queen hath played her part and begs to go


ay, vashti, go and never more return
not only hast thou wronged thine own true lord
and mocked and shamed me in the people’s eyes
but thou hast wronged all princes and all men
by thy pernicious and rebellious ways
queens act and subjects imitate.  so let
queen vashti weigh her conduct and her words
or be no more called ‘queen!’


i was a princess ere i was a queen
and worthy of a better fate than this
there lies the crown that made me queen in name
here stands the woman—wife in name alone
now, no more queen—nor wife—but woman still—
ay, and a woman strong enough to be
her own avenger



tell me thy name


my name, great sire, is esther


so thou art esther?  esther! ’tis a name
breathed into sound as softly as a sigh
a woman’s name should melt upon the lips
like love’s first kisses, and thy countenance
is fit companion for so sweet a name


thou art most kind.  i would my name and face
were mine own making and not accident
then i might feel elated at thy praise
where now i feel confusion


thou hast wit
as well as beauty, esther.  both are gems
that do embellish woman in man’s sight
yet they are gems of second magnitude
dost _thou_ possess the one great perfect gem—
the matchless jewel of the world called _love


sire, in the heart of every woman dwells
that wondrous perfect gem


then, esther, speak
and tell me what is _love_!  i fain would know
thy definition of that much-mouthed word
by woman most employed—least understood


what can a humble jewish maiden know
that would instruct a warrior and a king
i have but dreamed of love as maidens will
while thou hast known its fulness.  all the world
loves great ahasueras


all the world
are rarely loved as anything but kings
love, as i see it in the court and camp
means seeking royal favour.  i would know
how love is fashioned in a maiden’s dreams


sire, love seeks nothing that kings can bestow
love is the king of all kings here below
love makes the monarch but a bashful boy
love makes the peasant monarch in his joy
love seeks not place, all places are the same
when lighted by the radiance of love’s flame
who deems proud love could fawn to power and splendour
hath known not love, but some base-born pretender


if this be love, i would know more of it
speak on, fair esther!  what is love beside


love is in all things, all things are in love
love is the earth, the sea, the skies above
love is the bird, the blossom, and the wind
love hath a million eyes, yet love is blind
love is a tempest, awful in its might
love is the silence of a moon-lit night
love is the aim of every human soul
and he who hath not loved hath missed life’s goal


but tell me of thyself, of thine own dreams
how wouldst thou love, and how be loved again


who most doth love thinks least of love’s return
she is content to feel the passion burn
in her own bosom, and its sacred fire
consumes each selfish purpose and desire
’tis in the giving, love’s best rapture lies
not in the counting of the things it buys


yet, is there not vast anguish and despair
in love that finds no answering word or smile


so radiant is love, it lends a glow
to each dark sorrow and to every woe
to love completely is to part with pain
nor is there mortal who can love in vain
love is its own reward, it pays full measure
and in love’s sharpest grief lies subtlest pleasure


methinks, a mighty warrior, lord or king
must in thy fancy play the lover’s part
none else could wake such reverential thought


when woman loves one born of lowly state
her thought gives crown and sceptre to her mate
yet be he king, or chief of some great clan
she loves him but as woman loves a man
monarch or peasant, ’tis the same, i wis
when once she gives him love’s surrendering kiss



what were thy thoughts, sweet esther?  something passed
across thy face, that for a moment veiled
thy soul from mine, and left me desolate
thy thoughts were not of me


ay, _all_ of thee
i wondered, if in truth, thou wert content
with me—thy choice.  was there no other one
of all who passed before thee at thy court
whose memory pursues thee with regret


i do confess i much regret that day
and wish i could relive it


oh!  my lord


yea!  i regret those hours i wasted on
the poor procession that preceded thee
hadst thou come first, then all the added wealth

of one long day of loving thee were mine—
a boundless fortune squandered.  though i live
to three score years and ten, as i do hope
in wedded love beside thee, that one day
was filched from me and cannot be restored


and then to think how frightened and abashed
i hung outside thy gates from early morn
not daring to go in and meet thine eyes
till pitying twilight clothed me in her veil
and evening walked beside me to thy door


so it was thou, fair thief, who stole that day
and made me poorer, by—how many hours


full eight, i think.  they seemed a hundred then
and now time flies a hundred times too fast


then eight more kisses do i claim from thee
this very hour—first tithes of many due
i shall exact these payments as i will
and if they be not ready on demand
i’ll lock thee in the prison of my arms
like this—and take them so—and so—and so


but kings must think of other things than love
and live for other aims than happiness
i would not drag thee from thy altitude
of mighty ruler and great conqueror
to chain thee by my side


such slavery
would please me better than to conquer earth
without thee, esther.  i have stood on heights
and heard the cheers of multitudes below
have known the loneliness of being great
now, let me live and love thee, like a man
forgetting i am king—
i am content


content is not the pathway to great deeds
as man, i hold thee higher than all kings
as king, thou must stand higher than all men
in other eyes.  let no one say of me
‘she spoiled his greatness by her littleness
she made a languorous lover of a king
and silenced war-cries on commanding lips—
with honeyed kisses; made her woman’s arms
preferred to armour, and her couch to tents
until the kingdom, with no guiding hand
plunged down to ruin.’


thou wouldst have me go—
so soon thy heart hath wearied


my heart is bursting with its love for thee
canst thou not feel its fervour?  but great men
need wiser guidance than a woman’s heart
my pride in thee is equal to my love
and i would have thee greater than thou art—
ay, greater than all other men on earth—
though forced long years to feed my hungry heart
on food of memories and wine of tears
wert thou but winning glory and renown


thou art most noble, esther; thou art fit
to be the consort of a king of kings
but i have chewed upon ambition’s husks
and starved for love through all my manhood’s years
and now the mighty gods have seen it fit
to spread love’s banquet and to name thee host
may i not feast my fill?  o esther, take
the tempting nectar of those lips away
and give me wine to rouse the brute in me
to make me thirst for blood instead of love
wine!  wine!  i say


ahasueras, wait
methinks good music is wine turned to sound
here comes thy minstrel with an offering
pressed from the ripened fruit of my fond heart
mine own the words and mine the melody
and may it linger longer in thine ear
than on thy lip would stay the taste of wine
sing on


when from the field returning
love is a warrior’s yearning
love in his heart is burning
love is his dream
talk not to him of glory
speak not of faces gory
sing of love’s tender story
make it thy theme
sing of his lady’s tresses
sing of the smile that blesses
sing of the sweet caresses
and yet again
sing of fair children’s faces
sing of the dear home graces
sing till the vacant places
ring with thy strain
yet as the days go speeding
shall he arise unheeding
love songs or words of pleading
strong in his might
helmet and armour wearing
hies he to deeds of daring
forth to the battle faring
back to the fight
sing now of ranks contending
sing of loud voices blending
sing of great warriors sending
death to their foes
sing of war missiles humming
strike into martial drumming
sing of great victory coming
as forth he goes
back to the battle faring
back into deeds of daring
back to the fight


no less a lover but a greater man
a better warrior and a nobler king
i will be from this hour for thy dear sake


god finished woman in the twilight hour
and said, ‘to-morrow thou shalt find thy place
man’s complement, the mother of the race—
with love the motive power—
the one compelling power.’

all night she dreamed and wondered.  with the light
her lover came—and then she understood
the purpose of her being.  life was good
and all the world seemed right—
and nothing was, but right

she had no wish for any wider sway
by all the questions of the world unvexed
supremely loving and superbly sexed
she passed upon her way—
her feminine fair way

but god neglected, when he fashioned man
to fuse the molten splendour of his mind
with that sixth sense he gave to womankind
and so he marred his plan—
ay, marred his own great plan

she asked so little, and so much she gave
that man grew selfish: and she soon became
to god’s great sorrow and the whole world’s shame
man’s sweet and patient slave—
his uncomplaining slave

yet in the nights (oh! nights so dark and long
she clasped her little children to her breast
and wept.  and in her anguish of unrest
she thought upon her wrong
she knew how great her wrong

and one sad hour, she said unto her heart
‘since thou art cause of all my bitter pain
i bid thee abdicate the throne: let brain
rule now, and do his part—
his masterful, strong part.’

she wept no more.  by new ambition stirred
her ways led out, to regions strange and vast
men stood aside and watched, dismayed, aghast
and all the world demurred—
misjudged her, and demurred

still on and up, from sphere to widening sphere
till thorny paths bloomed with the rose of fame
who once demurred, now followed with acclaim
the hiss died in the cheer—
the loud applauding cheer

she stood triumphant in that radiant hour
man’s mental equal, and competitor
but ah! the cost! from out the heart of her
had gone love’s motive power—
love’s all-compelling power


i dreamed a voice, of one god-authorised
cried loudly thro’ the world, ‘disarm!  disarm!’
and there was consternation in the camps
and men who strutted under braid and lace
beat on their medalled breasts, and wailed, ‘undone!’
the word was echoed from a thousand hills
and shop and mill, and factory and forge
where throve the awful industries of death
hushed into silence.  scrawled upon the doors
the passer read, ‘peace bids her children starve.’
but foolish women clasped their little sons
and wept for joy, not reasoning like men

again the voice commanded: ‘now go forth
and build a world for progress and for peace
this work has waited since the earth was shaped
but men were fighting, and they could not toil
the needs of life outnumber needs of death
leave death with god.  go forth, i say, and build.’

and then a sudden, comprehensive joy
shone in the eyes of men; and one who thought
only of conquests and of victories
woke from his gloomy reverie and cried
‘ay, come and build!  i challenge all to try
and i will make a world more beautiful
than eden was before the serpent came.’
and like a running flame on western wilds
ambition spread from mind to listening mind
and lo! the looms were busy once again
and all the earth resounded with men’s toil

vast palaces of science graced the world
their banquet tables spread with feasts of truth
for all who hungered.  music kissed the air
once rent with boom of cannons.  statues gleamed
from wooded ways, where ambushed armies hid
in times of old.  the sea and air were gay
with shining sails that soared from land to land
a universal language of the world
made nations kin, and poverty was known

but as a word marked ‘obsolete,’ like war
the arts were kindled with celestial fire
new poets sang so homer’s fame grew dim
and brush and chisel gave the wondering race
sublimer treasures than old greece displayed
men differed still; fierce argument arose
for men are human in this human sphere
but unarmed arbitration stood between
and reason settled in a hundred hours
what war disputed for a hundred years

oh, that a voice, of one god-authorised
might cry to all mankind, disarm!  disarm


once in a time of trouble and of care
i dreamed i talked with god about my pain
with sleepland courage, daring to complain
of what i deemed ungracious and unfair
‘lord, i have grovelled on my knees in prayer
hour after hour,’ i cried; ‘yet all in vain
no hand leads up to heights i would attain
no path is shown me out of my despair.’

then answered god: ‘three things i gave to thee—
clear brain, brave will, and strength of mind and heart
all implements divine, to shape the way
why shift the burden of thy toil on me
till to the utmost he has done his part
with all his might, let no man _dare_ to pray.’


two thousand years had passed since christ was born
when suddenly there rose a mighty host
of women, sweeping to a central goal
as many rivers sweep on to the sea
they came from mountains, valleys, and from coasts
and from all lands, all nations, and all ranks
speaking all languages, but thinking one
and that one language—peace

‘listen,’ they said
and straightway was there silence on the earth
for men were dumb with wonder and surprise
‘listen, o mighty masters of the world
and hear the edict of all womankind
since christ his new commandment gave to men
have passed away, yet earth is red with blood
the strong male rulers of the world proclaim
their weakness, when we ask that war shall cease
now will the poor weak women of the world
proclaim their strength, and say that war shall end
hear, then, our edict: never from this day
will any woman on the crust of earth
mother a warrior.  we have sworn the oath
and will go barren to the waiting tomb
rather than breed strong sons at war’s behest
or bring fair daughters into life, to bear
the pains of travail, for no end but war
ay! let the race die out for lack of babes
better a dying race than endless wars
better a silent world than noise of guns
and clash of armies

‘long we asked for peace
and oft you promised—but to fight again
at last you told us, war must ever be
while men existed, laughing at our plea
for the disarmament of all mankind
then in our hearts flamed such a mad desire
for peace on earth, as lights the world at times
with some great conflagration; and it spread
from distant land to land, from sea to sea
until all women thought as with one mind
and spoke as with one voice; and now behold
the great crusading syndicate of peace
filling all space with one supreme resolve
give us, o men, your word that war shall end
disarm the world, and we will give you sons—
sons to construct, and daughters to adorn
a beautiful new earth, where there shall be
fewer and finer people, opulence
and opportunity and peace for all
until you promise peace no shrill birth-cry
shall sound again upon the aging earth
we wait your answer.’

and the world was still
while men considered


at times i am the mother of the world
and mine seem all its sorrows, and its fears
that rose, which in each mother-heart is curled
the rose of pity, opens with my tears
and, waking in the night, i lie and hark
to the lone sobbing, and the wild alarms
of my world-child, a wailing in the dark
the child i fain would shelter in my arms
i call to it (as from another room
a mother calls, what time she cannot go
‘sleep well, dear world; love hides behind this gloom
there is no need for wakefulness or woe
the long, long night is almost past and gone
the day is near.’  and yet the world weeps on

again i follow it, throughout the day
with anxious eyes i see it trip and fall
and hurt itself in many a foolish way
childlike, unheeding warning word or call
i see it grasp, and grasping, break the toys
it cried to own, then toss them on the floor
and, breathless, hurry after fancied joys
that cease to please, when added to its store
i see the lacerations on its hands
made by forbidden tools; but when it weeps
i also weep, as one who understands
and having been a child, the memory keeps
ah, my poor world, however wrong thy part
still is there pity in my mother-heart


i cried, ‘dear angel, lead me to the heights
and spur me to the top.’
the angel answered, ‘stop
and set thy house in order; make it fair
for absent ones who may be speeding there
then will we talk of heights.’

i put my house in order.  ‘now lead on!’
the angel said, ‘not yet
thy garden is beset
by thorns and tares; go weed it, so all those
who come to gaze may find the unvexed rose
then will we journey on.’

i weeded well my garden.  ‘all is done.’
the angel shook his head
‘a beggar stands,’ he said
‘outside thy gates; till thou hast given heed
and soothed his sorrow, and supplied his need
say not that all is done.’

the beggar left me singing.  ‘now at last—
at last the path is clear.’
‘nay, there is one draws near
who seeks, like thee, the difficult highway
he lacks thy courage; cheer him through the day
then will we cry, “at last!”’

i helped my weaker brother.  ‘now the heights
oh, guide me, angel, guide!’
the presence at my side
with radiant face, said, ‘look, where are we now?’
and lo! we stood upon the mountain’s brow—
the heights, the shining heights


not great vesuvius, in all his ire
nor all the centuries, could hide your shame
there is the little window where you came
with eyes that woke the demon of desire
and lips like rose leaves, fashioned out of fire
and from the lava leaps the molten flame
of your old sins.  the walls cry out your name—
your face seems rising from the funeral pyre

there must have dwelt, within your fated town
full many a virtuous dame, and noble wife
who made your beauty seem as star to sun
how strange the centuries have handed down
your name, fair julia, of immoral life
and left the others to oblivion


master of sweet and loving lore
give us the open mind
to know religion means no more
no less, than being kind

give us the comprehensive sight
that sees another’s need
and let our aim to set things right
prove god inspired our creed

give us the soul to know our kin
that dwell in flock and herd
the voice to fight man’s shameful sin
against the beast and bird

give us a heart with love so fraught
for all created things
that even our unspoken thought
bears healing on its wings

give us religion that will cope
with life’s colossal woes
and turn a radiant face of hope
on troops of pigmy foes

give us the mastery of our fate
in thoughts so warm and white
they stamp upon the brows of hate
love’s glorious seal of light

give us the strong, courageous faith
that makes of pain a friend
and calls the secret word of death
‘beginning,’ and not ‘end.’


what is right living?  just to do your best
when worst seems easier.  to bear the ills
of daily life with patient cheerfulness
nor waste dear time recounting them
to talk
of hopeful things when doubt is in the air
to count your blessings often, giving thanks
and to accept your sorrows silently
nor question why you suffer.  to accept
the whole of life as one perfected plan
and welcome each event as part of it
to work, and love your work; to trust, to pray
for larger usefulness and clearer sight
this is right living, pleasing in god’s eyes
though you be heathen, heretic or jew


however inexplicable may seem
event and circumstance upon this earth
though favours fall on those whom none esteem
and insult and indifference greet worth
though poverty repays the life of toil
and riches spring where idle feet have trod
and storms lay waste the patiently tilled soil—
yet justice sways the universe of god

as undisturbed the stately stars remain
beyond the glare of day’s obscuring light
so justice dwells, though mortal eyes in vain
seek it persistently by reason’s sight
but when, once freed, the illumined soul looks out
its cry will be, ‘o god, how could i doubt!’


time looked me in the eyes while passing by
the milestone of the year.  that piercing gaze
was both an accusation and reproach
no speech was needed.  in a sorrowing look
more meaning lies than in complaining words
and silence hurts as keenly as reproof

oh, opulent, kind giver of rich hours
how have i used thy benefits!  as babes
unstring a necklace, laughing at the sound
of priceless jewels dropping one by one
so have i laughed while precious moments rolled
into the hidden corners of the past
and i have let large opportunities
for high endeavour move unheeded by
while little joys and cares absorbed my strength

and yet, dear time, set to my credit this

be patient with me.  though the sun slants west
the day has not yet finished, and i feel
necessity for action and resolve
bear in upon my consciousness.  i know
the earth’s eternal need of earnest souls
and the great hunger of the world for love
i know the goal to high achievement lies
through the dull pathway of self-conquest first
and on the stairs of little duties done
we climb to joys that stand thy test.  o time
be patient with me, and another day
perchance, in passing by, thine eyes may smile


in what i do i note the marring flaw
the imperfections of the work i see
nor am i one who rather _do_ than _be
since its reversal is creation’s law

nay, since there lies a better and a worse
a lesser and a larger, in men’s view
i would be better than the thing i do
as god is greater than his universe

he shaped himself before he shaped one world
a million eons, toiling day and night
he built himself to majesty and might
before the planets into space were hurled

and when creation’s early work was done
what crude beginnings out of chaos came—
a formless nebula, a wavering flame
an errant comet, a voracious sun

and, still unable to perfect his plan
what awful creatures at his touch found birth—
those protoplasmic monsters of the earth
that owned the world before he fashioned man

and now, behold the poor unfinished state
of this, his latest masterpiece!  then why
be troubled that no voice proclaims it great

before me lie the cycling rounds of years
with this small earth will die the thing i do
the thing i am, goes journeying onward through
a million lives, upon a million spheres

my work i build, as best i can and may
knowing all mortal effort ends in dust
i build myself, not as i may, but must
knowing, or good, or ill, that self must stay

along the ages, out, and on, afar
its journey leads, and must perforce be made
likewise its choice, with things of shame and shade
or up the path of light, from star to star

when all these solar systems shall disperse
perchance this labour, and this self-control
may find reward; and my completed soul
will fling in space, a little universe


art thou alive?  nay, not too soon reply
tho’ hand, and foot, and lip, and ear, and eye
respond, and do thy bidding yet may be
grim death has done his direst work with thee
life, as god gives it, is a thing apart
from active body and from beating heart
it is the vital spark, the unseen fire
that moves the mind to reason and aspire
it is the force that bids emotion roll
in mighty billows from the surging soul

it is the light that grows from hour to hour
and floods the brain with consciousness of power
it is the spirit dominating all
and reaching god with its imperious call
until the shining glory of his face
illuminates each sorrowful, dark place

it is the truth that sets the bondsman free
knowing he will be what he wills to be
with its unburied dead the earth is sad
art thou alive? proclaim it and be glad
perchance the dead may hear thee and arise
knowing they live, and _here_ is paradise


i love this age of energy and force
expectantly i greet each pregnant hour
emerging from the all-creative source
supreme with promise, imminent with power
the strident whistle and the clanging bell
the noise of gongs, the rush of motored things
are but the prophet voices which foretell
a time when thought may use unfettered wings

too long the drudgery of earth has been
a barrier ’twixt man and his own mind
remove the stone, and lo! the christ within
for he is there, and who so seeks shall find
the great inventor is the modern priest
he paves the pathway to a higher goal
once from the grind of endless toil released
man will explore the kingdom of his soul

and all this restless rush, this strain and strife
this noise and glare is but the fanfarade
that ushers in the more majestic life
where faith shall walk with science, unafraid
i feel the strong vibrations of the earth
i sense the coming of an hour sublime
and bless the star that watched above my birth
and let me live in this important time


unto each mortal who comes to earth
a ladder is given by god, at birth
and up this ladder the soul must go
step by step, from the valley below
step by step, to the centre of space
on this ladder of lives, to the starting place

in time departed (which yet endures
i shaped my ladder, and you shaped yours
whatever they are—they are what we made
a ladder of light, or a ladder of shade
a ladder of love, or a hateful thing
a ladder of strength, or a wavering string
a ladder of gold, or a ladder of straw
each is the ladder of righteous law

we flung them away at the call of death
we took them again with the next life breath
for a keeper stands by the great birth gates
as each soul passes, its ladder waits
though mine be narrow, and yours be broad
on my ladder alone can i climb to god
on your ladder alone can your feet ascend
for none may borrow, and none may lend

if toil and trouble and pain are found
twisted and corded, to form each round
if rusted iron or mouldering wood
is the fragile frame, you must make it good
you must build it over and fashion it strong
though the task be hard as your life is long
for up this ladder the pathway leads
to earthly pleasures and spirit needs
and all that may come in another way
shall be but illusion, and will not stay

in useless effort, then, waste no time
rebuild your ladder, and climb and climb


who is a christian in this christian land
of many churches and of lofty spires
not he who sits in soft upholstered pews
bought by the profits of unholy greed
and looks devotion, while he thinks of gain
not he who sends petitions from the lips
that lie to-morrow in the street and mart
not he who fattens on another’s toil
and flings his unearned riches to the poor
or aids the heathen with a lessened wage
and builds cathedrals with an increased rent

christ, with thy great, sweet, simple creed of love
how must thou weary of earth’s ‘christian’ clans
who preach salvation through thy saving blood
while planning slaughter of their fellow men
who is a christian?  it is one whose life
is built on love, on kindness and on faith
who holds his brother as his other self
and hides no aim or purpose in his heart
that will not chord with universal good

though he be pagan, heretic or jew
that man is christian and beloved of christ


all your wonderful inventions
all your houses vast and tall
all your great gun-fronted vessels
every fort and every wall
with the passing of the ages
they shall pass and they shall fall

as you sit among the idols
that your avarice gave birth
as you count the hoarded treasures
that you think of priceless worth
time is digging tombs to hide them
in the bosom of the earth

there shall come a great convulsion
or a rushing tidal wave
or a sound of mighty thunders
from a subterranean cave
and a boasting world’s possessions
shall be buried in one grave

from the centuries of silence
we are bringing back again
buried vase and bust and column
and the gods they worshipped then
in the strange unmentioned cities
built by prehistoric men

did they steal, and lie, and slaughter
did they steep their souls in shame
did they sell eternal virtues
just to win a passing fame
did they give the gold of honour
for the tinsel of a name

we are hurrying all together
toward the silence and the night
there is nothing worth the seeking
but the sun-kissed moral height—
there is nothing worth the doing
but the doing of the _right


i asked the rock beside the road what joy existence lent
it answered, ‘for a million years my heart has been content.’

i asked the truffle-seeking swine, as rooting by he went
‘what is the keynote of your life?’  he grunted out, ‘content.’

i asked a slave, who toiled and sung, just what his singing meant
he plodded on his changeless way, and said, ‘i am content.’

i asked a plutocrat of greed, on what his thoughts were bent
he chinked the silver in his purse, and said, ‘i am content.’

i asked the mighty forest tree from whence its force was sent
its thousand branches spoke as one, and said, ‘from discontent.’

i asked the message speeding on, by what great law was rent
god’s secret from the waves of space.  it said, ‘from discontent.’

i asked the marble, where the works of god and man were blent
what brought the statue from the block.  it answered, ‘discontent.’

i asked an angel, looking down on earth with gaze intent
how man should rise to larger growth.  quoth he, ‘through discontent.’


slowly the people waken; they have been
like weary soldiers, sleeping in their tents
while traitors tiptoed through the silent camp
intent on plunder.  suddenly a sound—
a careless movement of too bold a thief—
starts one dull sleeper; then another stirs
a third cries out a warning, and at last
the people are awake!  oh, when as one
the many rise, united and alert
with justice for their motto, they reflect
the mighty force of god’s omnipotence
and nothing stands before them.  lusty greed
tyrannical corruption long in power
and smirking cant (whose right hand robs and slays
so that the left may dower church and school
monopoly, whose mandate took from toil
the mother earth, that idleness might loll
and breed the monster of colossal wealth—
all these must fall before the gathering force
of public indignation.  that old strife
which marks the progress of each century
the war of right with might, is on once more
and shame to him who does not take his stand

this is the weightiest moment of all time
and on the issues of the present hour
a nation’s honour and a country’s peace
a people’s future, ay, a world’s, depends

until the vital questions of the day
are solved and settled, and the spendthrift thieves
who rob the coffers of the saving poor
are led from fashion’s feasts to prison fare
and taught the saving grace of honest work—
till labour claims the privilege of toil
and toil the proceeds of its labour shares—
let no man sleep, let no man dare to sleep


i am sorry in the gladness
of the joys that crown my days
for the souls that sit in sadness
or walk uninviting ways

on the radiance of my labour
that a loving fate bestowed
falls the shadow of my neighbour
crushed beneath a thankless load

as the canticle of pleasure
from my lovelit altar rolls
there is one discordant measure
as i think of homeless souls

and i know that grim old story
preached from pulpits, is not so
for no god could sit in glory
and see sinners writhe below

in that great eternal centre
where all human life has birth
boundless love and pity enter
and flow downward to the earth

and all souls in sin or sorrow
are but passing through the night
and i know on some to-morrow
god will love them into light



i heard a strange voice in the distance calling
as from a star an echo might be falling

it spoke four syllables, concise and brief
charged with a god-sent message of relief

hark to the new command and comfort borrow

even as the master left his cross below
and rose to paradise, let go, let go

forget your wrongs, your troubles and your losses
for with the tools of thought we build our crosses

forget your griefs, all grudges and all fear
and enter paradise—its gates are near

heaven is a realm by loving souls created
and hell was fashioned by the hearts that hated

love, hope and trust; believe all joys are yours
life pays the soul whose confidence endures

the blows of adverse fate, by larger pleasures
as after storms the soil yields fuller measures

let go the cross; roll self—the stone—away
and dwell with love in paradise to-day


when the summer sun is shining
and the green things push and grow
oft my heart runs over measure
with its flowing fount of pleasure
as i feel the sea winds blow
ah, then life is good, i know

and i think of sweet birds building
and of children fair and free
and of glowing sun-kissed meadows
and of tender twilight shadows
and of boats upon the sea
oh, then life seems good to me

then unbidden and unwanted
come the darker, sadder sights
city shop and stifling alley
where misfortune’s children rally
and the hot crime-breeding nights
and the dearth of god’s delights

and i think of narrow prisons
where unhappy songbirds dwell
and of cruel pens and cages
where some captured wild thing rages
like a madman in his cell
in the zoo, the wild beasts’ hell

and i long to lift the burden
of man’s selfishness and sin
and to open wide earth’s treasures
of god’s storehouse, full of pleasures
for my dumb and human kin
and to ask the whole world in


between the ringing of bells and the musical clang of chimes
i hear a sound like the breaking of chains, all through these
christmas times
for the thought of the world is waking out of a slumber deep and long
and the race is beginning to understand how right can master wrong

and the eyes of the world are opening wide, and great are the truths
they see
and the heart of the world is singing a song, and its burden is ‘be
free!’
now the thought of the world and the wish of the world and the song of
the world will make
a force so strong that the fetters forged for a million years must
break

fetters of superstitious fear have bound the race to creeds
that hindered the upward march of man to the larger faith he needs
fetters of greed and pride have made the race bow down to kings
but the pompous creed and the costly throne must yield to simpler
things

the thought of the world has climbed above old paths for centuries
and cloth and crown no longer mean the ‘vested power of god.’
the race no longer bends beneath the weight of adam’s sin
but stands erect and knows itself the maker’s first of kin

and the need of the world and the wish of the world and the song of
the world i hear
all through the clanging and clashing of bells, this christmas time o’
the year
and i hear a sound like the breaking of chains, and it seems to say to
in the voice of one who spoke of old, ‘the truth shall make men free.’


upon december’s windy portico
the old year stood, and looked out where the sun
went wading down the west, through drifting clouds
‘i, too, shall sink full soon to rest,’ he sighed
‘and follow where my children’s feet have trod
brave january, beauteous may and june
my lovely daughters, and my valiant sons
all, all save one, have left me for that bourne
men call the past.  it seems but yesterday
i saw fair august, laughing with the sea
snaring the earth with her seductive wiles
and making conquest, even of the sun
yet has she gone, and left me here to mourn.’
then spake december, from an open door
‘father, the night grows cold; come in and rest
sit with me here beside this glowing grate
i have not left thee; thou art not alone
my house is thine; all warm with love and light
and bright with holly and with cedar sweet
my stalwart arm is thine to lean upon
the feast is spread, i only wait for thee
god smiles upon thy dead, smile thou on me.’
then through the open door the old year passed
and darkness settled on the outer world


however certain of the way thou art
take not the self-appointed leader’s part
follow no man, and by no man be led
and no man lead.  _awake_, and go ahead
thy path, though leading straight unto the goal
might prove confusing to another soul
the goal is central; but from east, and west
and north, and south, we set out on the quest
from lofty mountains, and from valleys low:—
how could all find one common way to go

lord buddha to the wilderness was brought
lord jesus to the cross.  and yet, think not
by solitude, or cross, thou canst achieve
lest in thine own true self thou dost believe
know thou art one, with life’s almighty source
then are thy feet set on the certain course

nor does it matter if thou feast, or fast
or what thy creed—or where thy lot is cast
in halls of pleasure or in crowded mart
in city streets, or from all men apart—
thy path leads to the light; and peace and power
shall be thy portion, growing hour by hour
follow no man, and by no man be led
and no man lead.  but _know_ and go ahead


what shall the leader be in that great day
when we who sleep and dream that we are slaves
shall wake and know that liberty is ours
mark well that word—not yours, not mine, but ours
for through the mingling of the separate streams
of individual protest and desire
in one united sea of purpose, lies
the course to freedom

when progression takes
her undisputed right of way, and sinks
the old traditions and conventions where
they may not rise, what shall the leader be

no mighty warrior skilled in crafts of war
sowing earth’s fertile furrows with dead men
and staining crimson god’s cerulean sea
to prove his prowess to a shuddering world

nor yet a monarch with a silly crown
perched on an empty head, an in-bred heir
to senseless titles and anemic blood

no ruler, purchased by the perjured votes
of striving demagogues whose god is gold
not one of these shall lead to liberty
the weakness of the world cries out for strength
the sorrow of the world cries out for hope
its suffering cries for kindness

he who leads
must then be strong and hopeful as the dawn
that rises unafraid and full of joy
above the blackness of the darkest night
he must be kind to every living thing
kind as the krishna, buddha and the christ
and full of love for all created life
oh, not in war shall his great prowess lie
nor shall he find his pleasure in the chase
too great for slaughter, friend of man and beast
touching the borders of the unseen realms
and bringing down to earth their mystic fires
to light our troubled pathways, wise and kind
and human to the core, so shall he be
the coming leader of the coming time


hear thou my prayer, great god of opulence
give me no blessings, save as recompense
for blessings which i lovingly bestow
on needy stranger or on suffering foe
if wealth, by chance, should on my path appear
let wisdom and benevolence stand near
and charity within my portal wait
to guard me from acquaintance intimate

yet in this intricate great art of living
guide me away from misdirected giving
and show me how to spur the laggard soul
to strive alone once more to gain the goal

repay my worldly efforts to attain
only as i develop heart and brain
nor brand me with the ‘dollar sign’ above
a bosom void of sympathy and love

if on the carrying winds my name be blown
to any land or time beyond my own
let it not be as one who gained the day
by crowding others from the chosen way
rather as one who missed the highest place
pausing to cheer spent runners in the race
the greater boon i ask, dear god, from thee


thank god for life, in such an age as this
rich with the promises of better things
thank god for being part of this great nation’s heart
whose strong pulsations are not ruled by kings

our thanks for fearless and protesting speech
when cloven hoofs show ’neath the robes of state
for us no servile song of ‘kings can do no wrong.’
not royal birth, but worth, makes rulers great

thank god for peace within our border lands
and for the love of peace within each soul
who thinks on peace has wrought, mosaic-squares of thought
in the foundation of our future goal

our thanks for love, and knowledge of love’s laws
love is a greater power than vested might
love is the central source of all enduring force
love is the law that sets the whole world right

our thanks for that increasing torch of light
the tireless hand of science holds abroad
and may its growing blaze shine on all hidden ways
till man beholds the silhouette of god


i know it is early morning
and hope is calling aloud
and your heart is afire with youth’s desire
to hurry along with the crowd
but linger a bit by the roadside
and lend a hand by the way
’tis a curious fact that a generous act
brings leisure and luck to a day

i know it is only the noontime—
there is chance enough to be kind
but the hours run fast when noon has passed
and the shadows are close behind
so think while the light is shining
and act ere the set of the sun
for the sorriest woe that a soul can know
is to think what it might have done

i know it is almost evening
but the twilight hour is long
if you listen and heed each cry of need
you can right full many a wrong
for when we have finished the journey
we will all look back and say
‘on life’s long mile there was nothing worth while
but the good we did by the way.’


when with clanging and with ringing
comes the year’s initial day
i can feel the rhythmic swinging
of the world upon its way
and though right still wears a fetter
and though justice still is blind
time’s beyond is always better
than the paths he leaves behind

in our eons of existence
as we circle through the night
we annihilate the distance
’twixt the darkness and the light
from beginnings crude and lowly
round and round our souls have trod
through the circles, winding slowly
up to knowledge and to god

with each century departed
some old evil found a tomb
some old truth was newly started
in propitious soil to bloom
with each epoch some condition
that has handicapped the race
unto knowledge yields its place

though in folly and in blindness
and in sorrow still we grope
yet in man’s increasing kindness
lies the world’s stupendous hope
for our darkest hour of errors
is as radiant as the dawn
set beside the awful terrors
of the ages that have gone

and above the sad world’s sobbing
and the strife of clan with clan
i can hear the mighty throbbing
of the heart of god in man
and a voice chants through the chiming
of the bells, and seems to say
we are climbing, we are climbing
as we circle on our way


life is a privilege.  its youthful days
shine with the radiance of continuous mays
to live, to breathe, to wonder and desire
to feed with dreams the heart’s perpetual fire
to thrill with virtuous passions and to glow
with great ambitions—in one hour to know
the depths and heights of feeling—god! in truth
how beautiful, how beautiful is youth

life is a privilege.  like some rare rose
the mysteries of the human mind unclose
what marvels lie in earth and air and sea
what stores of knowledge wait our opening key
what sunny roads of happiness lead out
beyond the realms of indolence and doubt
and what large pleasures smile upon and bless
the busy avenues of usefulness

life is a privilege.  though noontide fades
and shadows fall along the winding glades
though joy-blooms wither in the autumn air
yet the sweet scent of sympathy is there
pale sorrow leads us closer to our kind
and in the serious hours of life we find
depths in the soul of men which lend new worth
and majesty to this brief span of earth

life is a privilege.  if some sad fate
sends us alone to seek the exit gate
if men forsake us as the shadows fall
still does the supreme privilege of all
come in that reaching upward of the soul
to find the welcoming presence at the goal
and in the knowledge that our feet have trod
paths that lead from and must lead back to god


before the statue of a giant hun
there stood a dwarf, misshapen and uncouth
his lifted eyes seemed asking: ‘why, in sooth
was i not fashioned like this mighty one
would god show favour to an older son
like earthly kings, and beggar without ruth
another, who sinned only by his youth
why should two lives in such divergence run?’

strange, as he gazed, that from a vanished past
no memories revived of war and strife
of misused prowess, and of broken law
that old hun’s spirit, in the dwarf re-cast
lived out the sequence of an earthly life


god, what a world, if men in street and mart
felt that same kinship of the human heart
which makes them, in the face of flame and flood
rise to the meaning of true brotherhood


among the virile hosts he passed along
conspicuous for an undetermined grace
of sexless beauty.  in his form and face
god’s mighty purpose somehow had gone wrong
then on his loom, he wove a careful song
of sensuous threads; a wordy web of lace
wherein the primal passions of the race
and his own sins made wonder for the throng

a little pen prick opened up a vein
and gave the finished mesh a crimson blot—
the last consummate touch of studied art
but those who knew strong passion and keen pain
looked through and through the pattern and found not
one single great emotion of the heart


when god had formed the universe, he thought
of all the marvels therein to be wrought
and to his aid then motherhood was brought

‘my lesser self, the feminine of me
she will go forth throughout all time,’ quoth he
‘and make my world what i would have it be

‘for i am weary, having laboured so
and for a cycle of repose would go
into that silence which but god may know

‘therefore i leave the rounding of my plan
to motherhood; and that which i began
let woman finish in perfecting man

‘she is the soil: the human mother earth
she is the sun, that calls the seed to earth
she is the gardener, who knows its worth

‘from me, all seed, of any kind must spring
divine the growth such seed and soil will bring
for all is me, and i am everything.’

thus having spoken to himself aloud
his glorious face upon his breast he bowed
and sought repose behind a wall of cloud

come forth, o god! though great thy thought and good
in shaping woman for true motherhood
lord, speak again; she has not understood

the centuries pass: the cycles roll along—
the earth is peopled with a mighty throng
yet men are fighting and the world goes wrong

lord, speak again, ere yet it be too late
unloved, unwanted souls come through earth’s gate
the unborn child is given a dower of hate

thy world progresses in all ways save one
in motherhood, for which it was begun
lord, lord, behold how little has been done

children are spawned like fishes in the sand
with ignorance and crime they fill the land
lord, speak again, till mothers understand

it is not all of motherhood to know
conception pleasure or deliverance woe
who plants the seed should help the shoot to grow

better a barren soil than weed and tare
or sickly plants that die for want of care
in poisonous jungles, void of sun and air

true motherhood is not alone to breed
the human race; it is to know and heed
its holiest purpose and its highest need

lord, speak again, so woman shall be stirred
with the full meaning of that mighty word
true motherhood.  she has not rightly heard


unhoused in deserts of accepted thought
and lost in jungles of confusing creeds
my soul strayed, homeless, finding its own needs
unsatisfied with what tradition taught

the pros and cons, the little ifs and ands
the but and maybe, and the this and that
on which the churches thicken and grow fat
i found but structures built on shifting sands

and all their heavens were strange and far away
and all their hells were made of human hate
and since for death i did not care to wait
a heaven i fashioned for myself one day

of happy thoughts i built it stone by stone
with joy of life i draped each spacious room
with love’s great light i drove away all gloom
and in the centre i made god a throne

and this dear heaven i set within my heart
and carried it about with me alway
and then the changing dogmas of the day
seemed alien to my thoughts and held no part

now as i take my heaven from place to place
i find new rooms by love’s revealing light
and death will give me but a larger sight
to see my palace spreading into space


on a bleak, bald hill with a dull world under
the dreary world of the commonplace
i have stood when the whole world seemed a blunder
of dotard time, in an aimless race
with worry about me and want before me—
yet deep in my soul was a rapture spring
that made me cry to the grey sky o’er me
‘oh, i know this life is a goodly thing!’

i have given sweet years to a thankless duty
while cold and starving, though clothed and fed
for a young heart’s hunger for joy and beauty
is harder to bear than the need of bread
i have watched the wane of a sodden season
which let hope wither, and made care thrive
and through it all, without earthly reason
i have thrilled with the glory of being alive

and now i stand by the great sea’s splendour
where love and beauty feed heart and eye
the brilliant light of the sun grows tender
as it slants to the shore of the by and by
i prize each hour as a golden treasure—
a pearl time drops from a broken string
and all my ways are the ways of pleasure
and i know this life is a goodly thing

and i know, too, that not in the seeing
or having, or doing the things we would
lies that deep rapture that comes from being
and not from pleasure the heart may borrow
that rare contentment for which we strive
unless through trouble, and want, and sorrow
it has thrilled with the glory of being alive


there is no summit you may not attain
no purpose which you may not yet achieve
if you will wait serenely and believe
each seeming loss is but a step toward gain

between the mountain-tops lie vale and plain
let nothing make you question, doubt or grieve
give only good, and good alone receive
and as you welcome joy, so welcome pain

that which you most desire awaits your word
throw wide the door and bid it enter in
speak, and the strong vibrations shall be stirred
speak, and above earth’s loud, unmeaning din
your silent declarations shall be heard
all things are possible to god’s own kin


talk not of strength, until your heart has known
and fought with weakness through long hours alone

talk not of virtue, till your conquering soul
has met temptation and gained full control

boast not of garments, all unscorched by sin
till you have passed, unscathed, through fires within

oh, poor that pride the unscarred soldier shows
who safe in camp, has never faced his foes


a granite rock in the mountain side
gazed on the world and was satisfied
it watched the centuries come and go
it welcomed the sunlight, yet loved the snow
it grieved when the forest was forced to fall
yet joyed when steeples rose, white and tall
in the valley below it, and thrilled to hear
the voice of the great town roaring near

when the mountain stream from its idle play
was caught by the mill wheel and borne away
and trained to labour, the grey rock mused
‘trees and verdure and stream are used
by man the master; but i remain
friend of the mountain, and star, and plain
unchanged forever by god’s decree
while passing centuries bow to me.’

then all unwarned, with a mighty shock
out of the mountain was wrenched the rock
bruised and battered and broken in heart
it was carried away to the common mart
wrecked and ruined in piece and pride
‘oh, god is cruel,’ the granite cried
‘comrade of mountains, of stars the friend
by all deserted, how sad my end.’

a dreaming sculptor in passing by
gazed at the granite with thoughtful eye
then stirred with a purpose supremely grand
he bade his dream in the rock expand
and lo! from the broken and shapeless mass
that grieved and doubted, it came to pass
that a glorious statue of priceless worth
and infinite beauty, adorned the earth


‘_since sinus crossed the milky way_, _sixty thousand years have

since sirius crossed the milky way
full sixty thousand years have gone
yet hour by hour, and day by day
this tireless star speeds on and on

methinks he must be moved to mirth
by that droll tale of genesis
which says creation had its birth
for such a puny world as this

to hear how one who fashioned all
those solar systems, tier on tiers
expressed in little adam’s fall
the purpose of a million spheres

and, witness of the endless plan
to splendid wrath he must be wrought
by pigmy creeds presumptuous man
sends forth as god’s primeval thought

perchance from half a hundred stars
he hears as many curious things
from venus, jupiter and mars
and saturn with the beauteous rings

there may be students of the cause
who send their revelations out
and formulate their codes of laws
with heavens for faith and hells for doubt

on planets old ere form or place
was lent to earth, may dwell—who knows—
a god-like and perfected race
that hails great sirius as he goes

in zones that circle moon and sun
’twixt world and world, he may see souls
whose span of earthly life is done
still journeying up to higher goals

and on dead planets grey and cold
grim spectral souls, that harboured hate
life after life, he may behold
descending to a darker fate

and on his grand majestic course
he may have caught one glorious sight
of that vast shining central source
from which proceeds all life, all light

since sirius crossed the milky way
full sixty thousand years have gone
no mortal man may bid him stay
no mortal man may speed him on

no mortal mind may comprehend
what is beyond, what was before
to god be glory without end
let man be humble and adore


at fontainebleau, i saw a little bed
fashioned of polished wood, with gold ornate
ambition, hope, and sorrow, ay, and hate
once battled there, above a childish head
and there in vain, grief wept, and memory plead
it was so small! but ah, dear god, how great
the part it played in one sad woman’s fate
how wide the gloom, that narrow object shed

the symbol of an over-reaching aim
the emblem of a devastated joy
it spoke of glory, and a blasted home
of fleeting honours, and disordered fame
and the lone passing of a fragile boy



look in the eyes of trouble with a smile
extend your hand and do not be afraid
’tis but a friend who comes to masquerade
and test your faith and courage for awhile

fly, and he follows fast with threat and jeer
shrink, and he deals hard blow on stinging blow
but bid him welcome as a friend, and lo
the jest is off—the masque will disappear


is the way hard and thorny, oh, my brother
do tempests beat, and adverse wild winds blow
and are you spent, and broken, at each nightfall
yet with each morn you rise and onward go
brother, i know, i know
i, too, have journeyed so

is your heart mad with longing, oh, my sister
are all great passions in your breast aglow
does the white wonder of your own soul blind you
and are you torn with rapture and with woe
sister, i know, i know
i, too, have suffered so

is the road filled with snare and quicksand, pilgrim
do pitfalls lie where roses seem to grow
and have you sometimes stumbled in the darkness
and are you bruised and scarred by many a blow
pilgrim, i know, i know
i, too, have stumbled so

do you send out rebellious cry and question
as mocking hours pass silently and slow
does your insistent ‘wherefore’ bring no answer
while stars wax pale with watching, and droop low
i, too, have questioned so
but now _i know_, _i know
to toil, to strive, to err, to cry, to grow


when from the prison of its body free
my soul shall soar, before it goes to thee
thou great creator, give it power to know
the language of all sad, dumb things below
and let me dwell a season still on earth
before i rise to some diviner birth
invisible to men, yet seen and heard
and understood by sorrowing beast and bird—
invisible to men, yet always near
to whisper counsel in the human ear
and with a spell to stay the hunter’s hand
and stir his heart to know and understand
to plant within the dull or thoughtless mind
the great religious impulse to be kind

before i prune my spirit wings and rise
to seek my loved ones in their paradise
yea! even before i hasten on to see
that lost child’s face, so like a dream to me
i would be given this intermediate role
and carry comfort to each poor, dumb soul
and bridge man’s gulf of cruelty and sin
by understanding of his lower kin
’twixt weary driver and the straining steed
on wings of mercy would my spirit speed
and each should know, before his journey’s end
that in the other dwelt a loving friend
from zoo and jungle, and from cage and stall
i would translate each inarticulate call
each pleading look, each frenzied act and cry
and tell the story to each passer-by
and of a spirit’s privilege possessed
pursue indifference to its couch of rest
and whisper in its ear until in awe
it woke and knew god’s all-embracing law
of universal life—the one in all



‘hurry up!’
no lingering by old doors of doubt—
no loitering by the way
no waiting a to-morrow car
when you can board to-day
success is somewhere down the track
before the chance is gone
accelerate your laggard pace
swing on, i say, swing on—
hurry up

‘step lively!’
belated souls are following fast
they shout and signal, ‘wait.’
conductor time brooks no delay
he rings the bell of fate
but you can give the man behind
with one hand on the bar
a final chance to brook defeat
and board the moving car
step lively

‘move up!’
make way for others as you sit
or stand.  this crowded earth
has room for every journeying soul
en route to higher birth
ay, room and comfort, if no one
took double share or space
nor let his greed and selfishness
absorb another’s place
move up

‘hold fast!’
the jolting switch of obstacles
with jarring rails is near
stand firm of foot, be strong of grip
brace well and have no fear
the maker of the car of life
foresaw that curve—despair
and hung the straps of faith, and hope
so you might grasp them there
hold fast


send forth your heart’s desire, and work and wait
the opportunities of life are brought
to our own doors, not by capricious fate
but by the strong compelling force of thought


the wonderful age of the world i sing—
the age of battery, coil and spring
of steam, and storage, and motored thing

though faith may slumber and art seem dead
and all that is spoken has once been said
and all that is written were best unread

though hearts are iron and thoughts are steel
and all that has value is mercantile
yet marvellous truths shall the age reveal

ay, greater the marvels this age shall find
than all the centuries left behind
when faith was a bigot and art was blind

oh, sorry the search of the world for gods
through faith that slaughters and art that lauds
while reason sits on its throne and nods

but out of the leisure that men will know
when the cruel things of the sad earth go
a faith that is knowledge shall rise and grow

in the throb and whir of each new machine
thinner is growing the veil between
the visible earth and the worlds unseen

the true religion shall leisure bring
and art shall awaken and love shall sing
oh, ho! for the age of the motored thing



‘the night is cold, the hour is late, the world is bleak and drear
who is it knocking at my door?’


‘i am good cheer.’


‘your voice is strange; i know you not; in shadows dark i grope
what seek you here?’


‘friend, let me in; my name is hope.’


‘and mine is failure; you but mock the life you seek to bless
pass on.’


‘nay, open wide the door; i am success.’


‘but i am ill and spent with pain; too late has come your wealth
i cannot use it.’


‘listen, friend; i am good health.’


‘now, wide i fling my door.  come in, and your fair statements
prove.’


‘but you must open, too, your heart, for i am love.’


we have outgrown the helmet and cuirass
the spear, the arrow, and the javelin
these crude inventions of a cruder age
when men killed men to show their love of god
and he who slaughtered most was greatest king
we have outgrown the need of war
should men
unite in this one thought, all war would end

disarm the world; and let all nations meet
like men, not monsters, when disputes arise
when crossed opinions tangle into snarls
let courts untie them, and not armies cut
when state discussions breed dissensions, let
union and arbitration supersede
the hell-created implements of war
disarm the world! and bid destructive thought
slip like a serpent from the mortal mind
down through the marshes of oblivion.  soon
a race of gods shall rise!  disarm!  disarm


all wantonly in hours of joy
i made a song of pain
soon grief drew near, and paused to hear
and sang the sad refrain
again and yet again

then recklessly in my despair
i sang of hope one day
and joy turned back upon life’s track
and smiled, and came my way
and sat her down to stay


oh, a great world, a fair world, a true world i find it
a sun that never forgets to rise
on the darkest night, a star in the skies
and a god of love behind it

oh, a good life, a sweet life, a large life i take it
is what he offers to you, and me
a chance to do, and a chance to be
whatever we chose to make it

oh, a far way, a high way, a sure way he leads us
and if the journey at times seems long
we must trudge ahead, with a trustful song
and know at the end he needs us




the world is full of selfishness and greed
lord, i would lave its sin


yea, mortal, earth of thy good help has need
go cleanse _thyself_ within


mine ear is hurt by harsh and evil speech
i would reform men’s ways


there is but one convincing way to teach
speak _thou_ but words of praise


on every hand is wretchedness and grief
despondency and fear
lord, i would give my fellow men relief


be, then, all hope, all cheer


lord, i look outward and grow sick at heart
such need of change i see


mortal, look _in_.  do thy allotted part


a weed is but an unloved flower
go dig, and prune, and guide, and wait
until it learns its high estate
and glorifies some bower
a weed is but an unloved flower

all sin is virtue unevolved
release the angel from the clod—
go love thy brother up to god
behold each problem solved
all sin is virtue unevolved


who is the strong?  not he who puts to test
his sinews with the strong and proves the best
but he who dwells where weaklings congregate
and never lets his splendid strength abate

who is the good?  not he who walks each day
with moral men along the high, clean way
but he who jostles gilded sin and shame
yet will not sell his honour or his name

who is the wise?  not he who from the start
with wisdom’s followers has taken part
but he who looks in folly’s tempting eyes
and turns away, perceiving her disguise

who is serene?  not he who flees his kind
some mountain fastness, or some cave to find
but he who in the city’s noisiest scene
keeps calm within—he only is serene


body and mind, and spirit, all combine
to make the creature, human and divine

of this great trinity no part deny

affirm the body, beautiful and whole
the earth-expression of immortal soul

affirm the mind, the messenger of the hour
to speed between thee and the source of power

affirm the spirit, the eternal i—
of this great trinity no part deny


they stood before the angel at the gate
the angel asked: ‘why should you enter in?’
one said: ‘on earth my place was high and great;’
and one: ‘i warned my fellow-men from sin;’
another: ‘i was teacher of the faith
i scorned my life and lived in love with death.’

and one stood silent.  ‘speak!’ the angel said
‘what earthly deed has sent you here to-day?’
‘alas!  i did but follow where they led,’
he answered sadly: ‘i had lost my way—
so new the country, and so strange my flight
i only sought for guidance and for light.’

‘you have no passport?’  ‘none,’ the answer came
‘i loved the earth, tho’ lowly was my lot
i strove to keep my record free from blame
and make a heaven about my humble spot
a narrow life; i see it now, too late
so, angel, drive me from the heavenly gate.’

the angel swung the portal wide and free
and took the sorrowing stranger by the hand
‘nay, you alone,’ he said, ‘shall come with me
of all this waiting and insistent band
of what god gave, you built your paradise
behold your mansion waiting in the skies.’


unnumbered gods may unremembered die
a thousand creeds may perish and pass by
yet do i lift mine eyes to one on high

unnamed be he from whom creation came
there is no word whereby to speak his name
but petty men have mouthed it into shame

i lift mine eyes, and with a river’s force
my love’s full tide goes sweeping on its course
to that supreme and all-embracing source

then back through all those thirsting channels roll
the mighty billows of the over soul
and i am he, the portion and the whole

as little streams before the flood-tide flee
as rivers vanish to become the sea


oh, a word is a gem, or a stone, or a song
or a flame, or a two-edged sword
or a rose in bloom, or a sweet perfume
or a drop of gall, is a word

you may choose your word like a connoisseur
and polish it up with art
but the word that sways, and stirs, and stays
is the word that comes from the heart

you may work on your word a thousand weeks
but it will not glow like one
that all unsought, leaps forth white hot
when the fountains of feeling run

you may hammer away on the anvil of thought
and fashion your word with care
but unless you are stirred to the depths, that word
shall die on the empty air

for the word that comes from the brain alone
alone to the brain will speed
but the word that sways, and stirs, and stays
oh! that is the word men heed


lean on no mortal, love, and serve
but it was never god’s intent
your spirit from its path should swerve
to gain another’s point of view
as well might jupiter, or mars
go seeking help from other stars
instead of sweeping on, as you
look to the great eternal cause
and not to any man, for light
look in; and learn the wrong, and right
from your own soul’s unwritten laws
and when you question, or demur
let love be your interpreter


if fallacies come knocking at my door
i’d rather feed, and shelter full a score
than hide behind the black portcullis, doubt
and run the risk of barring one truth out

and if pretension for a time deceive
and prove me one too ready to believe
far less my shame, than if by stubborn act
i brand as lie, some great colossal fact

on my soul’s door, the latch-string hangs outside
within, the lighted candle.  let me guide
some errant follies, on their wandering way
rather, than wisdom give no welcoming ray


god, what a glory, is this consciousness
of life on life, that comes to those who seek
nor would i, if i might, to others speak
the fulness of that knowledge.  it can bless
only the eager souls, that willing, press
along the mountain passes, to the peak
not to the dull, the doubting, or the weak
will truth explain, or mystery confess

not to the curious or impatient soul
that in the start, demands the end be shown
and at each step, stops waiting for a sign
but to the tireless toiler toward the goal
shall the great miracles of god be known
and life revealed, immortal and divine


upon the wreckage of thy yesterday
design the structure of to-morrow.  lay
strong corner stones of purpose, and prepare
great blocks of wisdom, cut from past despair
shape mighty pillars of resolve, to set
deep in the tear-wet mortar of regret
work on with patience.  though thy toil be slow
yet day by day the edifice shall grow
believe in god—in thine own self believe
all that thou hast desired thou shalt achieve


our souls should be vessels receiving
the waters of love for relieving
the sorrows of men

for here lies the pleasure of living
in taking god’s bounties, and giving
the gifts back again


when the great universe was wrought
to might and majesty from naught
the all creative force was—

that force is thine.  though desolate
the way may seem, command thy fate
send forth thy thought—
create—_create


would you believe in presences unseen—
in life beyond this earthly life
be still: be stiller yet; and listen.  set the screen
of silence at the portal of your will
relax, and let the world go by unheard
and seal your lips with some all-sacred word

breathe ‘god,’ in any tongue—it means the same
love absolute: think, feel, absorb the thought
shut out all else; until a subtle flame
shall permeate your being, and shall glow

not in a moment, or an hour, or day
the knowledge comes; the power is far too great
to win in any desultory way
no soul is worthy till it learns to wait
day after day be patient, then, oh, soul
month after month—till, lo! the goal! the goal


give, and thou shalt receive.  give thoughts of cheer
of courage and success, to friend and stranger
and from a thousand sources, far and near
strength will be sent thee in thy hour of danger

give words of comfort, of defence, and hope
to mortals crushed by sorrow and by error
and though thy feet through shadowy paths may grope
thou shalt not walk in loneliness or terror

give of thy gold, though small thy portion be
gold rusts and shrivels in the hand that keeps it
it grows in one that opens wide and free
who sows his harvest is the one who reaps it

give of thy love, nor wait to know the worth
of what thou lovest; and ask no returning
and wheresoe’er thy pathway leads on earth
there thou shalt find the lamp of love-light burning


the leaf that ripens only in the sun
is dull and shrivelled ere its race is run
the leaf that makes a carnival of death
must tremble first before the north wind’s breath

the life that neither grief nor burden knows
is dwarfed in sympathy before its close
the life that grows majestic with the years
must taste the bitter tonic found in tears


fear is the twin of faith’s sworn foe, distrust
if one breaks in your heart the other must

fear is the open enemy of good
it means the god in man misunderstood

who walks with fear adown life’s road will meet
his boon companions, failure and defeat

but look the bully boldly in the eyes
with mien undaunted, and he turns and flies


between the finite and the infinite
the missing link of love has left a void
supply the link, and earth with heaven will join
in one continued chain of endless life

hell is wherever love is not, and heaven
is love’s location.  no dogmatic creed
no austere faith based on ignoble fear
can lead thee into realms of joy and peace
unless the humblest creatures on the earth
are bettered by thy loving sympathy
think not to find a paradise beyond

there is no sudden entrance into heaven
slow is the ascent by the path of love


i value more than i despise
my tendency to sin
because it helps me sympathise
with all my tempted kin

he who has nothing in his soul
that links him to the sod
knows not that joy of self-control
which lifts him up to god

and i am glad my heart can say
when others trip and fall
‘i understand it all.’


there was a thought he hid from all men’s eyes
and by his prudent life and deeds of worth
he left a goodly record upon earth
as one both pure and wise

but when he reached a dark unsightly door
beyond the grave, there stood his secret thought
it was the mansion he had built and brought
to dwell in, on that shore


an unkind tale was whispered in his ear
he paused to hear
his thoughts were food that helped a falsehood thrive
and keep alive

years dawned and died.  one day by venom’s tongue
his name was stung
he cried aloud, nor dreamed the lie was spawn
of thoughts long gone

each mental wave we send out from the mind
or base, or kind
completes its circuit, then with added force
seeks its own source


know this, ye restless denizens of earth
know this, ye seekers after joy and mirth
three things there are, eternal in their worth

love, that outreaches to the humblest things
work that is glad, in what it does and brings
and faith that soars upon unwearied wings

divine the powers that on this trio wait
supreme their conquest, over time and fate
love, work, and faith—these three alone are great


‘the slothful man saith, there is a lion in the way; a lion is in the
street.’—proverbs xxvi. 13

there are no lions in the street
no lions in the way
go seek the goal, thou slothful soul
awake, awake, i say

thou dost but dream of obstacles
in god’s great lexicon
that word illstarred, no page has marred
press on, i say, press on

nothing can keep thee from thine own
but thine own slothful mind
to one who knocks, each door unlocks
and he who seeks, shall find


lean on thyself until thy strength is tried
then ask god’s help; it will not be denied

use thine own sight to see the way to go
when darkness falls ask god the path to show

think for thyself and reason out thy plan
god has his work and thou hast thine, oh, man

exert thy will and use it for control
god gave thee jurisdiction of thy soul

all thine immortal powers bring into play
think, act, strive, reason, then look up and pray


who climbs the mountain does not always climb
the winding road slants downward many a time
yet each descent is higher than the last
has thy path fallen?  that will soon be past
beyond the curve the way leads up and on
think not thy goal forever lost or gone
keep moving forward; if thine aim is right
thou canst not miss the shining mountain height
who would attain to summits still and fair
must nerve himself through valleys of despair



‘there is no death, there are no dead.’
from zone to zone, from sphere to sphere
the souls of all who pass from here
by hosts of living thoughts are led
and dark or bright, those souls must tread
the paths they fashioned year on year
for hells are built of hate or fear
and heavens of love our lives have shed

across unatlassed worlds of space
and through god’s mighty universe
with thoughts that bless or thoughts that curse
each journeys to his rightful place
oh, greater truth no man has said
‘there is no death, there are no dead.’

it lifts the mourner from the sod
and bids him cast away the reed
of some uncomforting poor creed
and walk with knowledge for a rod
it bids the doubter seek the broad
vast fields, where living facts will feed
all those whose patience proves their need
of these immortal truths of god

it brings before the eyes of faith
those realms of radiance, tier on tier
where our beloved ‘dead’ appear
more beautiful because of ‘death.’
it speaks to grief: ‘be comforted
there is no death, there are no dead.’


hers was a lonely, shadowed lot
or so the unperceiving thought
who looked no deeper than her face
devoid of chiselled lines of grace—
no farther than her humble grate
and wondered how she bore her fate

yet she was neither lone nor sad
so much of love her spirit had
she found an ever-flowing spring
of happiness in everything

so near to her was nature’s heart
it seemed a very living part
of her own self; and bud and blade
and heat and cold, and sun and shade
and dawn and sunset, spring and fall
held raptures for her, one and all

the year’s four changing seasons brought
to her own door what thousands sought
in wandering ways and did not find—
diversion and content of mind

she loved the tasks that filled each day—
such menial duties; but her way
of looking at them lent a grace
to things the world deemed commonplace

obscure and without place or name
she gloried in another’s fame
poor, plain and humble in her dress
she thrilled when beauty and success
and wealth passed by, on pleasure bent
they made earth seem so opulent
yet none of quicker sympathy
when need or sorrow came, than she
and so she lived, and so she died

she woke as from a dream.  how wide
and wonderful the avenue
that stretched to her astonished view
and up the green ascending lawn
a palace caught the rays of dawn

then suddenly the silence stirred
with one clear keynote of a bird
a thousand answered, till ere long
the air was quivering bits of song
she rose and wandered forth in awe
amazed and moved by all she saw
for, like so many souls who go
away from earth, she did not know
the cord was severed

down the street
with eager arms stretched forth to greet
came one she loved and mourned in youth
her mother followed; then the truth
broke on her, golden wave on wave
of knowledge infinite.  the grave
the body and the earthly sphere
were gone!  immortal life was here
they led her through the palace halls
from gleaming mirrors on the walls
she saw herself, with radiant mien
and robed in splendour like a queen
while glory round about her shone
‘all this,’ love murmured, ‘is your own.’

and when she gazed with wondering eye
and questioned whence and where and why
love answered thus: ‘all heaven is made
by thoughts on earth; your walls were laid
year after year, of purest gold
the beauty of your mind behold
in this fair palace; ay, and more
waits farther on, so vast your store
i was not worthy when i died
to take my place here at your side
i toiled through long and weary years
from lower planes to these high spheres
and through the love you sent from earth
i have attained a second birth
oft when my erring soul would tire
i felt the strength of your desire
i heard you breathe my name in prayer
and courage conquered weak despair
ah! earth needs heaven, but heaven indeed
of earth has just as great a need.’

across the terrace with a bound
there sped a lambkin and a hound
and fondled her caressing hand

‘you loved them into paradise’
was answered to her questioning eyes
‘you taught them love; love has no end
nor does love’s life on form depend
if there be mortal without love
he wakes to no new life above
if love in humbler things exist
it must through other realms persist
hark!  hear the heavenly cherubim!’

then hushed and awed, with joy so vast
it knew no future and no past
she stood amidst the radiant throng
that came to swell love’s welcoming song—
this humble soul from earth’s far coast
the centre of the heavenly host

on earth they see her grave and say
‘she lies there till the judgment day;’
nor dream, so limited their thought
what miracles by love are wrought


o captain! my captain! our fearful trip is done
the ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won
the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting
while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring
but, o heart! heart! heart
o the bleeding drops of red
where on the deck my captain lies
fallen, cold and dead

o captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells
rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills
for you bouquets and ribboned wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding
for you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning
here captain! dear father
this arm beneath your head
it is some dream that on the deck
you've fallen cold and dead

my captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still
my father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse or will
the ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done
from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won
exult, o shores! and ring, o bells
but i, with mournful tread
walk the deck my captain lies
fallen, cold and dead



for i dipt into the future, far as human eye could see
saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be
saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails
pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales
heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew
from the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue
far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm
with the standards of the peoples plunging through the thunderstorm
till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battleflags were furl'd
in the parliament of man, the federation of the world
there the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe
and the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law



the breaking waves dashed high
on a stern and rock-bound coast
and the woods against a stormy sky
their giant branches tossed

and the heavy night hung dark
the hills and waters o'er
when a band of exiles moored their bark
on the wild new england shore

not as the conqueror comes
they, the true-hearted, came
not with the roll of the stirring drums
and the trumpet that sings of fame

not as the flying come
in silence and in fear
they shook the depths of the desert's gloom
with their hymns of lofty cheer

amidst the storms they sang
and the stars heard, and the sea
and the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang
to the anthem of the free

the ocean eagle soared
from his nest by the white wave's foam
and the rocking pines of the forest roared
this was their welcome home

there were men with hoary hair
amidst that pilgrim band
why had they come to wither there
away from their childhood's land

there was woman's fearless eye
lit by her deep love's truth
there was manhood's brow serenely high
and the fiery heart of youth

what sought they thus afar
bright jewels of the mine
the wealth of seas, the spoils of war
they sought a faith's pure shrine

ay, call it holy ground
the soil where first they trod
they have left unstained what there they found
freedom to worship god

once there was a little boy
whose name was robert reese
and every friday afternoon
he had to speak a piece

so many poems thus he learned
that soon he had a store
of recitations in his head
and still kept learning more

now this it is what happened
he was called upon one week
and totally forgot the piece
he was about to speak

his brain he vainly cudgeled
but no word was in his head
and so he spoke at random
and this is what he said

my beautiful, my beautiful
who standest proudly by
it was the schooner hesperus
the breaking waves dashed high

why is the forum crowded
what means this stir in rome
under a spreading chestnut tree
there is no place like home

when freedom from her mountain height
cried, "twinkle, little star
shoot if you must this old gray head
king henry of navarre

if you're waking, call me early
to be or not to be
curfew must not ring to-night
oh, woodman, spare that tree

charge, chester, charge! on, stanley, on
and let who will be clever
the boy stood on the burning deck
but i go on for ever


the kid has gone to the colors
and we don't know what to say
the kid we have loved and cuddled
stepped out for the flag to-day
we thought him a child, a baby
with never a care at all
but his country called him man-size
and the kid has heard the call

he paused to watch the recruiting
where, fired by the fife and drum
he bowed his head to old glory
and thought that it whispered: "come
the kid, not being a slacker
stood forth with patriot-joy
to add his name to the roster
and god, we're proud of the boy

the kid has gone to the colors
it seems but a little while
since he drilled a schoolboy army
in a truly martial style
but now he's a man, a soldier
and we lend him a listening ear
for his heart is a heart all loyal
unscourged by the curse of fear

his dad, when he told him, shuddered
his mother--god bless her!--cried
yet, blest with a mother-nature
she wept with a mother-pride
but he whose old shoulders straightened
was granddad--for memory ran
to years when he, too, a youngster
was changed by the flag to a man



summer of 'sixty-three, sir, and conrad was gone away
gone to the county-town, sir, to sell our first load of hay
we lived in the log house yonder, poor as ever you've seen
roschen there was a baby, and i was only nineteen

conrad, he took the oxen, but he left kentucky belle
how much we thought of kentuck, i couldn't begin to tell
came from the blue-grass country; my father gave her to me
when i rode north with conrad, away from the tennessee

conrad lived in ohio--a german he is, you know
the house stood in broad cornfields, stretching on, row after row
the old folks made me welcome; they were kind as kind could be
but i kept longing, longing, for the hills of the tennessee

oh, for a sight of water, the shadowed slope of a hill
clouds that hang on the summit, a wind that never is still
but the level land went stretching away to meet the sky
never a rise, from north to south, to rest the weary eye

from east to west, no river to shine out under the moon
nothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon
only the breathless sunshine, as i looked out, all forlorn
only the rustle, rustle, as i walked among the corn

when i fell sick with pining, we didn't wait any more
but moved away from the cornlands, out to this river shore
the tuscarawas it's called, sir--off there's a hill, you see
and now i've grown to like it next best to the tennessee

i was at work that morning. some one came riding like mad
over the bridge and up the road--farmer rouf's little lad
bareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say

he sweeps up all the horses--every horse that he can find
morgan, morgan the raider, and morgan's terrible men
with bowie knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen

the lad rode down the valley, and i stood still at the door
the baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor
kentuck was out in the pasture; conrad, my man, was gone
nearer, nearer, morgan's men were galloping, galloping on

sudden i picked up baby, and ran to the pasture bar
i led her down the gully that turns off there to the right
and tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight

as i ran back to the log house, at once there came a sound
the ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground
coming into the turnpike out from the white woman glen
morgan, morgan the raider, and morgan's terrible men

as near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm
but still i stood in the doorway with baby on my arm
they came, they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped along
morgan, morgan the raider, and his band, six hundred strong

weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through day
pushing on east to the river, many long miles away
to the border strip where virginia runs up into the west
and fording the upper ohio before they could stop to rest

on like the wind they hurried, and morgan rode in advance
bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways glance
and i was just breathing freely, after my choking pain
when the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein

frightened i was to death, sir; i scarce dared look in his face
as he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place
i gave him a cup, and he smiled--'twas only a boy, you see
faint and worn, with dim blue eyes; and he'd sailed on the tennessee

only sixteen he was, sir--a fond mother's only son
off and away with morgan before his life had begun
the damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish mouth
and i thought me of the mother waiting down in the south

oh! pluck was he to the backbone, and clear grit through and through
boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn't do
the boy was dying, sir, dying as plain as plain could be
worn out by his ride with morgan up from the tennessee

but when i told the laddie that i too was from the south
water came in his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth
then swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away

i had him into the log house, and worked and brought him to
i fed him, and i coaxed him, as i thought his mother'd do
and when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone
morgan's men--were miles; away, galloping, galloping on

morgan--morgan is waiting for me; oh, what will morgan say
but i heard a sound of tramping and kept him back from the door
the ringing sound of horses' hoofs that i had heard before

and on, on, came the soldiers--the michigan cavalry
and fast they rode, and black they looked, galloping rapidly
they had followed hard on morgan's track; they had followed day and night
but of morgan and morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight

and rich ohio sat startled through all those summer days
for strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways
now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east, now west
through river-valleys and cornland farms, sweeping away her best

a bold ride and a long ride; but they were taken at last
they almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast
but the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford
and morgan, morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword

well, i kept the boy till evening--kept him against his will
but he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still
when it was cool and dusky--you'll wonder to hear me tell
but i stole down to that gully, and brought up kentucky belle

i kissed the star on her forehead--my pretty gentle lass
but i knew that she'd be happy back in the old blue-grass
a suit of clothes of conrad's, with all the money i had
and kentuck, pretty kentuck, i gave to the worn-out lad

i guided him to the southward as well as i know how
the boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow
and then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell
as down the glen away she went, my lost kentucky belle

when conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high
baby and i were both crying--i couldn't tell him why
but a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall
and a thin old horse, with drooping head, stood in kentucky's stall

well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me
he knew i couldn't help it--'twas all for the tennessee
but, after the war was over, just think what came to pass
a letter, sir; and the two were safe back in the old blue-grass

the lad had got across the border, riding kentucky belle
and kentuck, she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well
he cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or spur
ah! we've had many horses since, but never a horse like her



i remember it all so very well, the first of my married life
that i can't believe it was years ago--it doesn't seem true at all
why, i just can see the little church where they made us man and wife
and the merry glow of the first wood-fire that danced on our cottage

to joe
and then, he worked in the planing mill, and drew the best of pay
and our cup was full when joey came,--our baby-boy, you know
so, all went well till that mill burned down and the owner moved away

it wasn't long till joe found work, but 'twas never quite the same
never steady, with smaller pay; so to make the two ends meet
he fell to inventin' some machine--i don't recall the name
but he'd sit for hours in his little shop that opens toward the
street

sit for hours, bent over his work, his tools all strewn about
i used to want to go in there to dust and sweep the floor
but 'twas just as if 'twas the parson there, writing his sermon out
even the baby--bless the child!--learned never to slam that door

people called him a clever man, and folks from the city came
to look at his new invention and wish my joe success
and joe would say, "little woman,"--for that was my old pet-name
dress

i didn't want 'em, the grand new things, but it made the big tears start
to see my joe with his restless eyes, his fingers worn away
to the skin and bone, for he wouldn't eat; and it almost broke my heart
when he tossed at night from side to side, till the dawning of the day

of course, with it all he lost his place. i couldn't blame the man
the foreman there at the factory, for losing faith in joe
for his mind was never upon his work, but on some invention-plan
as with folded arms and his head bent down he wandered to and fro

yet, he kept on workin' at various things, till our little money went
for wheels and screws and metal casts and things i had never seen
and i ceased to ask, "any pay, my dear?" with the answer, "not a cent
when his lock and his patent-saw had failed, he clung to that great
machine

i remember one special thing that year. he had bought some costly tool
when we wanted our boy to learn to read--he was five years old, you
he went to his class with cold, bare feet, till at last he came from
school
and gravely said, "don't send me back; the children tease me so

i hadn't the heart to cross the child, so, while i sat and sewed
he would rock his little sister in the cradle at my side
and when the struggle was hardest and i felt keen hunger's goad
driving me almost to despair--the little baby died

her father came to the cradle-side, as she lay, so small and white
i swear by heaven, i will give it up!" yet, like a thief, that night
he stole to the shop and worked; his brow all wet with a clammy dew

too proud to beg; too weak to work; and the weather cold and wild
i can only think of one dark night when the rain poured from the sky
and the wind went wailing round the house, like the ghost of my buried
child

joe still toiled in the little shop. somebody clicked the gate
a neighbor-lad brought in the mail and laid it on the floor
but i sat half-stunned by my heavy grief crouched over the empty grate
till i heard--the crack of a pistol-shot; and i sprang to the workshop

that door was locked and the bolt shut fast. i could not cry, nor speak
but i snatched my boy from the corner there, sick with a sudden dread
and carried him out through the garden plot, forgetting my arms were weak
forgetting the rainy torrent that beat on my bare young head

the front door yielded to my touch. i staggered faintly in
fearing--_what_? he stood unharmed, though the wall showed a
jagged hole
in his trembling hand, his aim had failed, and the great and deadly sin
of his own life's blood was not yet laid on the poor man's tortured soul

but the pistol held another charge, i knew; and like something mad
i shook my fist in my poor man's face, and shrieked at him, fierce and

all of a sudden, he bowed his head, while from his nerveless hand
that hung so limp, i almost feared to see the pistol fall
a hopeless man. my plan has failed. that letter tells you all

then for a moment the house was still as ever the house of death
only the drip of the rain outside, for the storm was almost o'er
but no;--there followed another sound, and i started, caught my breath
as a stalwart man with a heavy step came in at the open door

i shall always think him an angel sent from heaven in a human guise
he must have guessed our awful state; he couldn't help but see
there was something wrong; but never a word, never a look in his eyes
told what he thought, as in kindly way he talked to joe and me

he was come from a thriving city firm, and they'd sent him here to say
that _one_ of joe's inventions was a great, successful thing
and which do you think? his window-catch that he'd tinkered up one day
and we were to have a good per cent on the sum that each would bring

and then the pleasant stranger went, and we wakened as from a dream
my man bent down his head and said, "little woman, you've saved my life
the worn look gone from his dear gray eyes, and in its place, a gleam
from the sun that has shone so brightly since, on joe and his happy



there sat two glasses filled to the brim
on a rich man's table, rim to rim
one was ruddy and red as blood
and one was clear as the crystal flood

said the glass of wine to his paler brother
i can tell of banquet and revel and mirth
where i was king, for i ruled in might
for the proudest and grandest souls of earth
fell under my touch, as though struck with blight
from the heads of kings i have torn the crown
from the heights of fame i have hurled men down
i have blasted many an honored name
i have taken virtue and given shame
i have tempted youth with a sip, a taste
that has made his future a barren waste
or than any army beneath the sky
i have made the arm of the driver fail
and sent the train from the iron rail
i have made good ships go down at sea
and the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me
fame, strength, wealth, genius before me fall
and my might and power are over all
ho, ho, pale brother," said the wine

said the water glass: "i cannot boast
of a king dethroned, or a murdered host
but i can tell of hearts that were sad
by my crystal drops made bright and glad
of thirsts i have quenched and brows i have laved
of hands i have cooled, and souls i have saved
i have leaped through the valley, dashed down the mountain
slipped from the sunshine, and dripped from the fountain
i have burst my cloud-fetters, and dropped from the sky
and everywhere gladdened the prospect and eye
i have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain
i have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain
i can tell of the powerful wheel of the mill
that ground out the flour, and turned at my will
i can tell of manhood debased by you
that i have uplifted and crowned anew
i cheer, i help, i strengthen and aid
i gladden the heart of man and maid
i set the wine-chained captive free
and all are better for knowing me

these are the tales they told each other
the glass of wine, and its paler brother
as they sat together, filled to the brim
on a rich man's table, rim to rim



london "punch

broad for the self-complacent british sneer
his length of shambling limb, his furrowed face

his gaunt, gnarled hands, his unkempt, bristling hair
his garb uncouth, his bearing ill at ease
his lack of all we prize as debonair
of power or will to shine, of art to please

judging each step, as though the way were plain
reckless, so it could point its paragraph
of chief's perplexity, or people's pain

beside this corpse, that bears for winding-sheet
the stars and stripes he lived to rear anew
between the mourners at his head and feet
say, scurril jester, is there room for you

yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer
to lame my pencil and confute my pen
to make me own this hind, of princes peer
this rail-splitter, a true-born king of men

my shallow judgment i had learned to rue
noting how to occasion's height he rose
how his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true
how, iron-like, his temper grew by blows

how humble, yet how hopeful he could be
how in good fortune and in ill the same
nor bitter in success, nor boastful he
thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame

he went about his work--such work as few
ever had laid on head, and heart, and hand
as one who knows where there's a task to do
man's honest will must heaven's good grace command

who trusts the strength will with the burden grow
that god makes instruments to work his will
if but that will we can arrive to know
nor tamper with the weights of good and ill

so he went forth to battle, on the side
that he felt clear was liberty's and right's
as in his peasant boyhood he had plied
his warfare with rude nature's thwarting mights

the uncleared forest, the unbroken soil
the iron bark that turns the lumberer's axe
the rapid, that o'erbears the boatman's toil
the prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks

the ambushed indian and the prowling bear
such were the needs that helped his youth to train
rough culture--but such trees large fruit may bear
if but their stocks be of right girth and grain

so he grew up, a destined work to do
and lived to do it: four long, suffering years
ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report, lived through
and then he heard the hisses change to cheers

the taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise
and took both with the same unwavering mood
till, as he came on light, from darkling days
and seemed to touch the goal from where he stood

a felon hand, between the goal and him
beached from behind his back, a trigger prest
and those perplexed and patient eyes were dim
those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest

the words of mercy were upon his lips
forgiveness in his heart and on his pen
when this vile murderer brought swift eclipse
to thoughts of peace on earth, goodwill to men

the old world and the new, from sea to sea
utter one voice of sympathy and shame
sore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high
sad life, cut short as its triumph came


somewhat back from the village street
stands the old-fashioned country-seat
across its antique portico
tall poplar trees their shadows throw
and, from its station in the hall
an ancient timepiece says to all
never--forever

half-way up the stairs it stands
and points and beckons with its hands
from its case of massive oak
like a monk who, under his cloak
crosses himself, and sighs, alas
with sorrowful voice to all who pass
never--forever

by day its voice is low and light
but in the silent dead of night
distinct as a passing footstep's fall
it echoes along the vacant hall
along the ceiling, along the floor
and seems to say at each chamber door
never--forever

through days of sorrow and of mirth
through days of death and days of birth
through every swift vicissitude
of changeful time, unchanged it has stood
and as if, like god, it all things saw
it calmly repeats those words of awe
never--forever

in that mansion used to be
free-hearted hospitality
his great fires up the chimney roared
the stranger feasted at his board
but, like the skeleton at the feast
that warning timepiece never ceased
never--forever

there groups of merry children played
there youths and maidens dreaming strayed
oh, precious hours! oh, golden prime
and affluence of love and time
even as a miser counts his gold
those hours the ancient timepiece told
never--forever

from that chamber, clothed in white
the bride came forth on her wedding night
there, in that silent room below
the dead lay, in his shroud of snow
and, in the hush that followed the prayer
was heard the old clock on the stair
never--forever

all are scattered, now, and fled
some are married, some are dead
and when i ask, with throbs of pain
as in the days long since gone by
the ancient timepiece makes reply
never-forever

never here, forever there
where all parting, pain, and care
and death, and time, shall disappear
forever there, but never here
the horologe of eternity
sayeth this incessantly
never--forever



we had forgotten you, or very nearly
you did not seem to touch us very nearly
of course we thought about you now and then
especially in any time of trouble
we knew that you were good in time of trouble
but we were very ordinary men

and there were always other things to think of
there's lots of things a man has got to think of
his work, his home, his pleasure, and his wife
and so we only thought of you on sunday
sometimes, perhaps, not even on a sunday
because there's always lots to fill one's life

and, all the while, in street or lane or byway
in country lane, in city street, or byway
you walked among us, and we did  not see
your feet were bleeding as you walked our pavements
how did we miss your footprints on our pavements
can there be other folk as blind as we

now we remember; over here in flanders
this hideous warfare seems to make things clear
we never thought about you much in england
but now that we are far away from england
we have no doubts, we know that you are here

you helped us pass the jest along the trenches
where, in cold blood, we waited in the trenches
you touched its ribaldry and made it fine
you stood beside us in our pain and weakness
we're glad to think you understand our weakness
somehow it seems to help us not to whine

we think about you kneeling in the garden
ah, god, the agony of that dread garden
we know you prayed for us upon the cross
if anything could make us glad to bear it
pain--death--the uttermost of human loss

though we forgot you--you will not forget us
we feel so sure that you will not forget us
but stay with us until this dream is past
and so we ask for courage, strength, and pardon
especially, i think, we ask for pardon
and that you'll stand beside us to the last



that lightly draws its breath
and feels its life in every limb
what should it know of death

i met a little cottage girl
she was eight years old, she said
her hair was thick with many a curl
that clustered round her head

she had a rustic, woodland air
and she was wildly clad
her eyes were fair, and very fair

how many may you be
and wondering looked at me

she answered, "seven are we
and two of us at conway dwell
and two are gone to sea

my sister and my brother
dwell near them with my mother

and two are gone to sea
yet ye are seven!--i pray you tell
sweet maid, how this may be

then did the little maid reply
two of us in the church-yard lie
beneath the church-yard tree

your limbs they are alive
if two are in the church-yard laid
then ye are only five

the little maid replied
and they are side by side

my kerchief there i hem
and there upon the ground i sit
and sing a song to them

when it is light and fair
i take my little porringer
and eat my supper there

in bed she moaning lay
till god released her of her pain
and then she went away

and, when the grass was dry
together round her grave we played

and i could run and slide
my brother john was forced to go
and he lies by her side

quick was the little maid's reply

their spirits are in heaven
the little maid would have her will
and said, "nay, we are seven



what to a novice she could say
of courtship, love and matrimony
quoth echo plainly,--'matter-o'-money

a dashing damsel, gay and pert
a pattern of inconstancy
or selfish, mercenary flirt
quoth echo, sharply,--'nary flirt

that long has lured the dear deceiver
she promise to amend her life
and sin no more; can i believe her
quoth echo, very promptly,--'leave her

on me should venture to bestow it
pray should i act the wiser part
to take the treasure or forego it
quoth echo, with decision,--'go it

to bind her fate in hymen's fetter
she vow she means to die a maid
in answer to my loving letter
quoth echo, rather coolly,-'let her

i find my heart entwined about
with cupid's dear, delicious chain
so closely that i can't get out
quoth echo, laughingly,--'get out

as pure and fair as heaven can make her
will share my labor and my rest
till envious death shall overtake her
quoth echo (sotto voce),--'take her



it's noon when thirty-five is due
an' she comes on time like a flash of light
an' you hear her whistle "too-tee-too
long 'fore the pilot swings in sight
bill madden's drivin' her in to-day
an' he's calling his sweetheart far away
gertrude hurd lives down by the mill
you might see her blushin'; she knows it's bill

six-five, a.m. there's a local comes
makes up at bristol, runnin' east
an' the way her whistle sings and hums
is a livin' caution to man and beast
every one knows who jack white calls
little lou woodbury, down by the falls
summer or winter, always the same
she hears her lover callin' her name

but at one fifty-one, old sixty-four
boston express, runs east, clear through
drowns her rattle and rumble and roar
with the softest whistle that ever blew
an' away on the furthest edge of town
sweet sue winthrop's eyes of brown
shine like the starlight, bright and clear
when she hears the whistle of abel gear

along at midnight a freight comes in
leaves berlin sometime--i don't know when
but it rumbles along with a fearful din
till it reaches the y-switch there and then
the clearest notes of the softest bell
that out of a brazen goblet fell
wake nellie minton out of her dreams
to her like a wedding-bell it seems

tom willson rides on the right-hand side
givin' her steam at every stride
an' he touches the whistle, low an' clear
for lulu gray on the hill, to hear

so it goes all day an' all night
till the old folks have voted the thing a bore
old maids and bachelors say it ain't right
for folks to do courtin' with such a roar
but the engineers their kisses will blow
from a whistle valve to the girls they know
an' stokers the name of their sweethearts tell
with the "too-too-too" and the swinging bell



she stood at the bar of justice
a creature wan and wild
in form too small for a woman
in features too old for a child
for a look so worn and pathetic
was stamped on her pale young face
it seemed long years of suffering
must have left that silent trace

with kindly look yet keen
and your age?"--"i am turned fifteen
he slowly and gravely read
with stealing three loaves of bread

and i hope that you can show
the charge to be false. now, tell me
are you guilty of this, or no
a passionate burst of weeping
was at first her sole reply
but she dried her eyes in a moment
and looked in the judge's eye

my father and mother are dead
and my little brothers and sisters
were hungry and asked me for bread
at first i earned it for them
by working hard all day
but somehow, times were bad, sir
and the work all fell away

the weather was bitter cold
the young ones cried and shivered
so what was i to do, sir
i am guilty, but do not condemn
i _took_--oh, was it _stealing
the bread to give to them

every man in the court-room
gray-beard and thoughtless youth
knew, as he looked upon her
that the prisoner spake the truth
out from their pockets came kerchiefs
out from their eyes sprung tears
and out from their old faded wallets
treasures hoarded for years

the judge's face was a study
the strangest you ever saw
as he cleared his throat and murmured
for one so learned in such matters
so wise in dealing with men
he seemed, on a simple question
sorely puzzled, just then

but no one blamed him or wondered
when at last these words he heard
is, for the present, deferred
and no one blamed him or wondered
when he went to her and smiled
and tenderly led from the court-room
himself, the "guilty" child


where did you come from, baby dear

where did you get your eyes so blue

what makes the light in them sparkle and spin

where did you get that little tear

what makes your forehead so smooth and high

what makes your cheek like a warm white rose

whence that three-cornered smile of bliss

where did you get that pearly ear

where did you get those arms and hands

feet, whence did you come, you darling things

how did they all just come to be you

but how did you come to us, you dear



the sea! the sea! the open sea
the blue, the fresh, the ever free
without a mark, without a bound
it runneth the earth's wide regions round
it plays with the clouds; it mocks the skies
or like a cradled creature lies

i'm on the sea! i'm on the sea
i am where i would ever be
with the blue above and the blue below
and silence wheresoe'er i go
if a storm should come and awake the deep
what matter? _i_ shall ride and sleep

i love, oh, how i love to ride
on the fierce, foaming, bursting tide
when every mad wave drowns the moon
or whistles aloud his tempest tune
and tells how goeth the world below
and why the southwest blasts do blow

i never was on the dull, tame shore
but i loved the great sea more and more
and back i flew to her billowy breast
like a bird that seeketh its mother's nest
and a mother she _was_, and _is_, to me
for i was born on the open sea

i've lived, since then, in calm and strife
full fifty summers a sailor's life
with wealth to spend and a power to range
but never have sought nor sighed for change
and death, whenever he comes to me
shall come on the wild, unbounded sea



and here he paused a while
to fringe his words the merest mite
with something of a smile
a smile that found its image
in a face of beauteous mold
whose liquid eyes were peeping
from a broidery of gold

if--" then he stopped again
as if his heart had bubbled o'er
and overflowed his brain
his lips were twitching nervously
o'er what they had to tell
and timed the quavers with the eyes
that gently rose and fell

and held them in his own
that on her cheeks had blown
the throbbing of her heart
that told how love had entered in
and claimed its every part

with just the faintest sigh
but what's the reason why
forbore its sweets to tell
has any pigs to sell


slowly england's sun was setting o'er the hilltops far away
filling all the land with beauty at the close of one sad day
and the last rays kissed the forehead of a man and maiden fair
he with footsteps slow and weary, she with sunny floating hair
he with bowed head, sad and thoughtful, she with lips all cold and white
struggling to keep back the murmur, "curfew must not ring to-night

with its turrets tall and gloomy, with its walls dark, damp and cold
at the ringing of the curfew, and no earthly help is nigh
cromwell will not come till sunset," and her lips grew strangely white
as she breathed the husky whisper: "curfew must not ring to-night

like the piercing of an arrow, like a deadly poisoned dart
every evening, just at sunset, it has told the twilight hour
i have done my duty ever, tried to do it just and right
now i'm old i will not falter,--curfew, it must ring to-night

wild her eyes and pale her features, stern and white her thoughtful brow
as within her secret bosom bessie made a solemn vow
she had listened while the judges read without a tear or sigh
and her breath came fast and faster, and her eyes grew large and bright
in an undertone she murmured, "curfew must not ring to-night

with quick step she bounded forward, sprung within the old church door
left the old man treading slowly paths so oft he'd trod before
not one moment paused the maiden, but with eye and cheek aglow
mounted up the gloomy tower, where the bell swung to and fro
as she climbed the dusty ladder on which fell no ray of light
up and up,--her white lips saying: "curfew must not ring to-night

she has reached the topmost ladder; o'er her hangs the great, dark bell
awful is the gloom beneath her, like the pathway down to hell
lo, the ponderous tongue is swinging--'tis the hour of curfew now
and the sight has chilled her bosom, stopped her breath and paled her brow
shall she let it ring? no, never! flash her eyes with sudden light
as she springs and grasps it firmly--"curfew shall not ring to-night

out she swung--far out; the city seemed a speck of light below
there 'twixt heaven and earth suspended as the bell swung to and fro
and the sexton at the bell-rope, old and deaf, heard not the bell
sadly thought, "that twilight curfew rang young basil's funeral knell
still the maiden clung more firmly, and with trembling lips so white
said, to hush her heart's wild throbbing: "curfew shall not ring to-night

it was o'er; the bell ceased swaying, and the maiden stepped once more
firmly on the dark old ladder where, for hundred years before
human foot had not been planted. the brave deed that she had done
should be told long ages after; as the rays of setting sun
crimson all the sky with beauty, aged sires with heads of white
tell the eager, listening children, "curfew did not ring that night

o'er the distant hills came cromwell; bessie sees him, and her brow
lately white with fear and anguish, has no anxious traces now
at his feet she tells her story, shows her hands all bruised and torn
and her face so sweet and pleading, yet with sorrow pale and worn
touched his heart with sudden pity, lit his eyes with misty light

wide they flung the massive portal; led the prisoner forth to die
all his bright young life before him. 'neath the darkening english sky
bessie comes with flying footsteps, eyes aglow with love-light sweet
kneeling on the turf beside him, lays his pardon at his feet
in his brave, strong arms he clasped her, kissed the face upturned
and white
whispered, "darling, you have saved me--curfew will not ring to-night



have you heard how a girl saved the lightning express
of kate shelly, whose father was killed on the road
were he living to-day, he'd be proud to possess
such a daughter as kate. ah! 'twas grit that she showed
on that terrible evening when donahue's train
jumped the bridge and went down, in the darkness and rain

she was only eighteen, but a woman in size
with a figure as graceful and lithe as a doe
with peach-blossom cheeks, and with violet eyes
and teeth and complexion like new-fallen snow
with a nature unspoiled and unblemished by art
with a generous soul, and a warm, noble heart

men linger at home by their bright-blazing fires
the wind wildly howls with a horrible sound
and shrieks through the vibrating telegraph wires
the fierce lightning flashes along the dark sky
the rain falls in torrents; the river rolls by

the scream of a whistle; the rush of a train
the sound of a bell! a mysterious light
that flashes and flares through the fast falling rain
a rumble! a roar! shrieks of human affright
the falling of timbers! the space of a breath
a splash in the river; then darkness and death

kate shelly recoils at the terrible crash
the sounds of destruction she happens to hear
she springs to the window--she throws up the sash
and listens and looks with a feeling of fear
the tall tree-tops groan, and she hears the faint cry
of a drowning man down in the river near by

her heart feebly flutters, her features grow wan
and then through her soul in a moment there flies
a forethought that gives her the strength of a man
she turns to her trembling old mother and cries
then out through the door disappears in the shower

she flies down the track through the pitiless rain
she reaches the river--the water below
whirls and seethes through the timbers. she shudders again
then closely about her she gathers her gown
and on the wet ties with a shiver sinks down

then carefully over the timbers she creeps
on her hands and knees, almost holding her breath
the loud thunder peals and the wind wildly sweeps
and struggles to hurry her downward to death
but the thought of the train to destruction so near
removes from her soul every feeling of fear

with the blood dripping down from each torn, bleeding limb
slowly over the timbers her dark way she feels
her fingers grow numb and her head seems to swim
her strength is fast failing--she staggers! she reels
she falls--ah! the danger is over at last
her feet touch the earth, and the long bridge is passed

in an instant new life seems to come to her form
she springs to her feet and forgets her despair
on, on to moingona! she faces the storm
she reaches the station--the keeper is there
there's death on the bridge at the river to-night

out flashes the signal-light, rosy and red
then sounds the loud roar of the swift-coming train
the hissing of steam, and there, brightly ahead
the gleam of a headlight illumines the rain
she heeds the red signal--she slackens, she's still

ah! noble kate shelly, your mission is done
your deed that dark night will not fade from our gaze
an endless renown you have worthily won
let the nation be just, and accord you its praise
let your name, let your fame, and your courage declare
what a _woman_ can do, and a _woman_ can dare



an old wife sat by her bright fireside
swaying thoughtfully to and fro
in an easy chair, whose creaky craw
told a tale of long ago
while down by her side, on the kitchen floor
stood a basket of worsted balls--a score

the good man dozed o'er the latest news
till the light in his pipe went out
and, unheeded, the kitten with cunning paws
rolled and tangled the balls about
yet still sat the wife in the ancient chair
swaying to and fro in the fire-light glare

but anon, a misty teardrop came
in her eyes of faded blue
then trickled down in a furrow deep
like a single drop of dew
so deep was the channel--so silent the stream
that the good man saw naught but the dimmed eye-beam

yet marveled he much that the cheerful light
of her eye had heavy grown
and marveled he more at the tangled balls
so he said in a gentle tone
conceal not from me thy sorrows now

then she spoke of the time when the basket there
was filled to the very brim
and now, there remained of the goodly pile
but a single pair--for him
there's but one pair of stockings to mend to-night

whose wrappings were wont to lay
in the basket, awaiting the needle's time
now wandering so far away
how the sprightly steps to a mother dear
unheeded fell on the careless ear

by the hearth there's a vacant seat
and i miss the shadows from off the wall
and the patter of many feet
at the one pair of stockings to mend to-night

and over the mountains bold
was a land whose rivers and darkening caves
were gemmed with the rarest gold
then my first-born turned from the oaken door
and i knew the shadows were only four

and diminished the basket's store
but his feet grew cold--so weary and cold
they'll never be warm any more
and this nook, in its emptiness, seemeth to me
to give forth no voice but the moan of the sea

and made them a home in its light
and fairy fingers have taken their share
to mend by the fireside bright
some other baskets their garments will fill
but mine, ah, mine is emptier still

was taken by angels away
and clad in a garment that waxeth not old
in a land of continual day
oh! wonder no more at the dimmed eye-light
when i mend the one pair of stockings to-night


in the room below the young man sat
with an anxious face and a white cravat
a throbbing heart and a silken hat
and various other things like that
which he had accumulated
and the maid of his heart was up above
surrounded by hat and gown and glove
and a thousand things which women love
but no man knoweth the names thereof
and the young man sat and--waited

you will scarce believe the things i tell
but the truth thereof i know full well
though how may not be stated
but i swear to you that the maiden took
a sort of half-breed, thin stove-hook
and heated it well in the gaslight there
and thrust it into her head, or hair
then she took something off the bed
and hooked it onto her hair, or head
and piled it high, and piled it higher
and drove it home with staples of wire
and the young man anxiously--waited

then she took a thing she called a "puff
and some very peculiar whitish stuff
and using about a half a peck
she spread it over her face and neck
and she looked as fair as a lilied bower
or a pound of lard or a sack of flour
and the young man wearily--waited

then she took a garment of awful shape
and it wasn't a waist, nor yet a cape
but it looked like a piece of ancient mail
or an instrument from a russian jail
and then with a fearful groan and gasp
she squeezed herself in its deathly clasp
so fair and yet so fated
and then with a move like i don't know what
she tied it on with a double knot
and the young man wofully--waited

then she put on a dozen different things
a mixture of buttons and hooks and strings
till she strongly resembled a notion store
then, taking some seventeen pins or more
she thrust them into her ruby lips
then stuck them around from waist to hips
and never once hesitated
and the maiden didn't know, perhaps
that the man below had had seven naps
and that now he sleepily--waited

and then she tried to put on her hat
ah me, a trying ordeal was that
she tipped it high and she tried it low
but every way that the thing would go
only made her more agitated
it wouldn't go straight and it caught her hair
and she wished she could hire a man to swear
but alas, the only man lingering there
was the one who wildly--waited

and then before she could take her leave
she had to puff up her monstrous sleeve
then a little dab here and a wee pat there
and a touch or two to her hindmost hair
then around the room with the utmost care
she thoughtfully circulated
then she seized her gloves and a chamoiskin
some breath perfume and a long stickpin
a bonbon box and a cloak and some
eau-de-cologne and chewing-gum
her opera glass and sealskin muff
a fan and a heap of other stuff
then she hurried down, but ere she spoke
something about the maiden broke
so she scurried back to the winding stair
and the young man looked in wild despair
and then he--evaporated



out of the night that covers me
black as the pit from pole to pole
i thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul

in the fell clutch of circumstance
i have not winced nor cried aloud
under the bludgeonings of chance
my head is bloody, but unbowed

beyond this place of wrath and tears
looms but the horror of the shade
and yet the menace of the years
finds, and shall find, me unafraid

it matters not how strait the gate
how charged with punishments the scroll
i am the master of my fate
i am the captain of my soul



two brown heads with tossing curls
red lips shutting over pearls
bare feet, white and wet with dew
two eyes black, and two eyes blue
little girl and boy were they
katie lee and willie grey

they were standing where a brook
bending like a shepherd's crook
flashed its silver, and thick ranks
of willow fringed its mossy banks
half in thought, and half in play
katie lee and willie grey

they had cheeks like cherries red
he was taller--'most a head
she, with arms like wreaths of snow
swung a basket to and fro
as she loitered, half in play
chattering to willie grey

and there came a dash of red
through the brownness of his cheek
and i'll carry, so i will
katie's basket up the hill

katie answered with a laugh
and then, tossing back her curls
do you think that katie guessed
half the wisdom she expressed

men are only boys grown tall
hearts don't change much, after all
and when, long years from that day
katie lee and willie grey
stood again beside the brook
bending like a shepherd's crook

is it strange that willie said
while again a dash of red
crossed the brownness of his cheek
life is but a slippery steep
hung with shadows cold and deep

walk beside me without fear
may i carry, if i will
all your burdens up the hill
and she answered, with a laugh

close beside the little brook
bending like a shepherd's crook
washing with its silver hands
late and early at the sands
is a cottage, where to-day
katie lives with willie grey

in a porch she sits, and lo
swings a basket to and fro
vastly different from the one
that she swung in years agone
and has--_rockers at the side


abou ben adhem--may his tribe increase
awoke one night from a deep dream of peace
and saw, within the moonlight in his room
making it rich, and like a lily in bloom
an angel, writing in a book of gold
exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold
and to the presence in the room he said
and, with a look made all of sweet accord
answered, "the names of those who love the lord
replied the angel.--abou spoke more low
but cheerily still; and said, "i pray thee, then
write me as one that loves his fellow-men

the angel wrote, and vanished. the next night
it came again, with a great wakening light
and showed the names whom love of god had blessed
and, lo! ben adhem's name led all the rest



still sits the school-house by the road
a ragged beggar sunning
around it still the sumachs grow
and blackberry vines are running

within, the master's desk is seen
deep scarred by raps official
the warping floor, the battered seats
the jack-knife's carved initial

the charcoal frescoes on its wall
its door's worn sill, betraying
the feet that, creeping slow to school
went storming out to playing

long years ago a winter sun
shone over it at setting
lit up its western window-panes
and low eaves' icy fretting

it touched the tangled golden curls
and brown eyes full of grieving
of one who still her steps delayed
when all the school were leaving

for near her stood the little boy
her childish favor singled
his cap pulled low upon a face
where pride and shame were mingled

pushing with restless feet the snow
to right and left, he lingered
as restlessly her tiny hands
the blue-checked apron fingered

he saw her lift her eyes; he felt
the soft hand's light caressing
and heard the tremble of her voice
as if a fault confessing

i hate to go above you
because,"--the brown eyes lower fell

still memory to a gray-haired man
that sweet child-face is showing
dear girl: the grasses on her grave
have forty years been growing

he lives to learn, in life's hard school
how few who pass above him
lament their triumph and his loss
like her,--because they love him



they were never made to handle a hoe
and at once to a college ought to go
there's fred, he's little better than a fool
but john and henry must go to school

as he set his mug of cider down
than both his brothers do in three
book larnin' will never plant one's corn
nor hoe potatoes, sure's you're born
nor mend a rod of broken fence
for my part, give me common sense

but his wife was bound the roost to rule
and john and henry were sent to school
while fred, of course, was left behind
because his mother said he had no mind

five years at school the students spent
then into business each one went
john learned to play the flute and fiddle
and parted his hair, of course, in the middle
while his brother looked rather higher than he

meanwhile, at home, their brother fred
had taken a notion into his head
but he quietly trimmed his apple trees
and weeded onions and planted peas
while somehow or other, by hook or crook
he managed to read full many a book
until at last his father said
he was getting "book larnin'" into his head

the war broke out, and captain fred
a hundred men to battle led
and when the rebel flag came down
went marching home as general brown
but he went to work on the farm again
and planted corn and sowed his grain
he shingled the barn and mended the fence
till people declared he had common sense

now common sense was very rare
and the state house needed a portion there
so the "family dunce" moved into town
the people called him governor brown
and the brothers who went to the city school
came home to live with "mother's fool

god give us men; a time like this demands
strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands
men whom the lust of office cannot kill
men whom the spoils of office cannot buy
men who possess opinions and a will
men who have honor; men who will not lie
men who can stand before a demagogue
and brave his treacherous flatteries without winking
tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog
in public duty and in private thinking
for while the rabble, with its thumb-worn creeds
its large professions, and its little deeds
mingle in selfish strife--lo! freedom weeps
wrong rules the land, and waiting justice sleeps



my good man is a clever man, which no one will gainsay
he lies awake to plot and plan 'gainst lions in the way
while i, without a thought of ill, sleep sound enough for three
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me

a holiday we never fix but he is sure 'twill rain
and when the sky is clear at six he knows it won't remain
he is always prophesying ill to which i won't agree
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me

the wheat will never show a top--but soon how green the field
we will not harvest half a crop--yet have a famous yield
it will not sell, it never will! but i will wait and see
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me

we have a good share of worldly gear, and fortune seems secure
yet my good man is full of fear--misfortune's coming sure
he points me out the almshouse hill, but cannot make me see
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me

he has a sort of second sights and when the fit is strong
he sees beyond the good and right the evil and the wrong
heaven's cop of joy he'll surely spill unless i with him be
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me



order, said the law court
knowledge, said the school
truth, said the wise man
pleasure, said the fool
love, said the maiden
beauty, said the page
freedom, said the dreamer
home, said the sage
fame, said the soldier
equity, the seer
spake my heart full sadly
then within my bosom
softly this i heard
kindness is the word



there's a funny tale 'of a stingy man
who was none too good but might have been worse
who went to his church, on a sunday night
and carried along his well-filled purse

when the sexton came with the begging plate
the church was but dim with the candle's light
the stingy man fumbled all thro' his purse
and chose a coin by touch and not by sight

it's an odd thing now that guineas should be
so like unto pennies in shape and size

the penny fell down with a clatter and ring
and back in his seat leaned the stingy man

ha! ha! how the sexton smiled, to be sure
to see the gold guinea fall in the plate
ha! ha! how the stingy man's heart was wrung
perceiving his blunder--but just too late

that guinea of gold is set down to me
they lend to him who give to the poor
it will not so bad an investment be

he knew it was only by accident
that out o' thy fingers the guinea fell

but in that account he'll set down to thee
na mair o' that golden guinea, my mon
than the one bare penny ye mean to gie

there's comfort, too, in the little tale
a serious side as well as a joke
a comfort for all the generous poor
in the comical words the sexton spoke

a comfort to think that the good lord knows
how generous we really desire to be
and will give us credit in his account
for all the pennies we long "to gie

we shall do so much in the years to come
but what have we done to-day
we shall give out gold in princely sum
but what did we give to-day
we shall lift the heart and dry the tear
we shall plant a hope in the place of fear
we shall speak with words of love and cheer
but what have we done to-day
we shall be so kind in the after while
but what have we been to-day
we shall bring to each lonely life a smile
but what have we brought to-day
we shall give to truth a grander birth
and to steadfast faith a deeper worth
we shall feed the hungering souls of earth
but whom have we fed to-day



my name is tommy, an' i hates
that feller of my sister kate's
he's bigger'n i am an' you see
he's sorter lookin' down on me
an' i resents it with a vim
i think i am just as good as him
he's older, an' he's mighty fly

one time he came,--down by the gate
i guess it must have been awful late
an' katie, she was there, an' they
was feelin' very nice and gay
an' he was talkin' all the while
about her sweet an' lovin' smile
an' everythin' was as nice as pie

they didn't see me, 'cause i slid
down underneath a bush, an' hid
an' he was sayin' that his love
was greater'n all the stars above
up in the glorious heavens placed
an' then his arms got 'round her waist
an' clouds were floatin' in the sky

i didn't hear just all they said
but by an' by my sister's head
was droopin' on his shoulder, an
i seen him holdin' katie's hand
an' then he hugged her closer, some
an' then i heerd a kiss--yum, yum
an' katie blushed an' drew a sigh

an' then that feller looked around
an' seed me there, down on the ground
an'--was he mad? well, betcher boots
i gets right out of there an' scoots
an' he just left my sister kate
a-standin' right there by the gate
an' i seen blood was in his eye

i runned the very best i could
but he cotched up--i's 'fraid he would
an' then he said he'd teach me how
to know my manners, he'd allow
an' then he shaked me awful. gee
he jest--he frashed the ground with me
an' then he stopped it by and by

an' then he went back to the gate
an' couldn't find my sister kate
was runnin' 'round an' thumpin' me
i got round in a shadder dim
an' made a face, an' guffed at him
an' then the moon larfed, in the sky



is it worth while that we jostle a brother
bearing his load on the rough road of life
is it worth while that we jeer at each other
in blackness of heart that we war to the knife
god pity us all in our pitiful strife

god pity as all as we jostle each other
god pardon us all for the triumph we feel
when a fellow goes down 'neath his load on the heather
pierced to the heart: words are keener than steel
and mightier far for woe than for weal

were it not well, in this brief little journey
on over the isthmus, down into the tide
we give him a fish instead of a serpent
ere folding the hands to be and abide
forever and aye in dust at his side

look at the roses saluting each other
look at the herds all at peace on the plain
man, and man only, makes war on his brother
and laughs in his heart at his peril and pain
shamed by the beasts that go down on the plain

is it worth while that we battle to humble
some poor fellow down into the dust
god pity us all! time too soon will tumble
all of us together, like leaves in a gust
humbled, indeed, down into the dust



there are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave
there are souls that are pure and true
then give to the world the best you have
and the best will come back to you

give love, and love to your life will flow
a strength in your utmost need
have faith, and a score of hearts will show
their faith in your work and deed

give truth, and your gift will be paid in kind
and honor will honor meet
and the smile which is sweet will surely find
a smile that is just as sweet

give pity and sorrow to those who mourn
you will gather in flowers again
the scattered seeds from your thought outborne
though the sowing seemed in vain

for life is the mirror of king and slave
then give to the world the best you have
and the best will come back to you



a boy drove into the city, his wagon loaded down
with food to feed the people of the british-governed town
and the little black-eyed rebel, so cunning and so sly
was watching for his coming from the corner of her eye

his face was broad and honest, his hands were brown and tough
the clothes he wore upon him were homespun, coarse, and rough
but one there was who watched him, who long time lingered nigh
and cast at him sweet glances from the corner of her eye

he drove up to the market, he waited in the line
his apples and potatoes were fresh and fair and fine
but long and long he waited, and no one came to buy
save the black-eyed rebel, watching from the corner of her eye

and, "who wants my potatoes?" he repeated to the crowd
but from all the people round him came no word of reply
save the black-eyed rebel, answering from the corner of her eye

for she knew that 'neath the lining of the coat he wore that day
were long letters from the husbands and the fathers far away
who were fighting for the freedom that they meant to gain, or die
and a tear like silver glistened in the corner of her eye

but the treasures--how to get them? crept the question through her mind
since keen enemies were watching for what prizes they might find
and she paused a while and pondered, with a pretty little sigh
then resolve crept through her features, and a shrewdness fired her eye

so she resolutely walked up to the wagon old and red
and the brown face flushed to scarlet, for the boy was somewhat shy
and he saw her laughing at him from the corner of her eye

and she clambered on the wagon, minding not who all were by
with a laugh of reckless romping in the corner of her eye

clinging round his brawny neck, she clasped her fingers white and small
and then whispered, "quick! the letters! thrust them underneath my shawl
carry back again _this_ package, and be sure that you are spry
and she sweetly smiled upon him from the corner of her eye

loud the motley crowd was laughing at the strange, ungirlish freak
and the boy was scared and panting, and so dashed he could not speak
and "miss, i have good apples," a bolder lad did cry
but she answered, "no, i thank you," from the corner of her eye

with the news from loved ones absent to the dear friends they would greet
searching them who hungered for them, swift she glided through the street
thought the little black-eyed rebel with a twinkle in her eye



if you sit down at set of sun
and count the deeds that you have done
and, counting, find
one self-denying act, one word that eased the heart of him that heard
one glance most kind, which felt like sunshine where it went
then you may count that day well spent

but if through, all the livelong day
you've eased no heart by yea or nay
if through it all you've nothing done that you can trace
that brought the sunshine to one face
no act most small that helped some soul and nothing cost
then count that day as worse than lost


say not the struggle nought availeth
the labor and the wounds are vain
the enemy faints not, nor faileth
and as things have been they remain

if hopes were dupes, fears may be liars
it may be, in yon smoke concealed
your comrades chase e'en now the fliers
and, but for you, possess the field

for while the tired waves, vainly breaking
seem here no painful inch to gain
far back, through creeks and inlets making
comes silent, flooding in, the main

and not by eastern windows only
when daylight comes, comes in the light
in front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly
but westward, look, the land is bright



there dwelt a miller, hale and bold
beside the river dee
he worked and sang from morn till night
no lark more blithe than he
and this the burden of his song
forever used to be
and nobody envies me

for could my heart be light as thine
i'd gladly change with thee
and tell me now, what makes thee sing
with voice so loud and free
while i am sad, though i'm a king
beside the river dee

the miller smiled and doffed his cap
i love my children three
i owe no penny i cannot pay
i thank the river dee
that turns the mill that grinds the corn
that feeds my babes and me

but say no more, if thou'dst be true
that no one envies thee
thy mealy cap is worth my crown
thy mill my kingdom's fee
such men as thou art england's boast
o miller of the dee



take me back to the days when the old red cradle rocked
in the sunshine of the years that are gone
to the good old trusty days, when the door was never locked
and we slumbered unmolested till the dawn

i remember of my years i had numbered almost seven
and the old cradle stood against the wall
i was youngest of the five, and two were gone to heaven
but the old red cradle rocked us all

and if ever came a day when my cheeks were flushed and hot
when i did not mind my porridge or my play
i would clamber up its side and the pain would be forgot
when the old red cradle rocked away

it has been a hallowed spot where i've turned through all the years
which have brought me the evil with the good
and i turn again to-night, aye, and see it through my tears
the place where the dear old cradle stood

by its side my father paused with a little time to spare
and the care-lines would soften on his brow
ah! 't was but a little while that i knew a father's care
but i fancy in my dreams i see him now

by my mother it was rocked when the evening meal was laid
and again i seem to see her as she smiled
when the rest were all in bed, 'twas there she knelt and prayed
by the old red cradle and her child

aye, it cradled one and all, brothers, sisters in it lay
and it gave me the sweetest rest i've known
but to-night the tears will flow, and i let them have their way
for the passing years are leaving me alone

and it seems of those to come, i would gladly give them all
for a slumber as free from care as then
just to wake to-morrow morn where the rising sun would fall
round the old red cradle once again

but the cradle long has gone and the burdens that it bore
one by one, have been gathered to the fold
still the flock is incomplete, for it numbers only four
with one left out straying in the cold

heaven grant again we may in each other's arms be locked
where no sad tears of parting ever fall
god forbid that one be lost that the old red cradle rocked
and the dear old cradle rocked us all



my papa held me up to the moo cow moo
so close i could almost touch
and i fed him a couple of times or so
and i wasn't a fraid-cat, much

but if my papa goes in the house
and my mamma she goes in too
i keep still like a little mouse
for the moo cow moo might moo

the moo cow's tail is a piece of rope
all raveled out where it grows
and it's just like feeling a piece of soap
all over the moo cow's nose

and the moo cow moo has lots of fun
just switching his tail about
but if he opens his mouth, why then i run
for that's where the moo comes out

the moo cow moo has deers on his head
and his eyes stick out of their place
and the nose of the moo cow moo is spread
all over the moo cow's face

and his feet are nothing but fingernails
and his mamma don't keep them cut
and he gives folks milk in water pails
when he don't keep his handles shut

but if you or i pull his handles, why
the moo cow moo says it hurts
but the hired man sits down close by
and squirts, and squirts, and squirts



all things bright and beautiful
all creatures great and small
all things wise and wonderful
the lord god made them all

each little flower that opens
each little bird that sings
he made their glowing colors
he made their tiny wings

the rich man in his castle
the poor man at his gate
god made them, high or lowly
and ordered their estate

the purple-headed mountain
the river running by
the morning, and the sunset
that lighteth up the sky

the cold wind in the winter
the pleasant summer sun
the ripe fruits in the garden
he made them, every one

the tall trees in the greenwood
the meadows where we play
the rushes by the water
we gather every day

he gave us eyes to see them
and lips that we might tell
how great is god almighty
who hath made all things well



oh, good painter, tell me true
has your hand the cunning to draw
shapes of things that you never saw
aye? well, here is an order for you

woods and cornfields, a little brown
the picture must not be over-bright
yet all in the golden and gracious light
of a cloud, when the summer sun is down
alway and alway, night and morn
woods upon woods, with fields of corn
lying between them, not quite sere
and not in the full, thick, leafy bloom
when the wind can hardly find breathing-room
under their tassels,--cattle near
biting shorter the short green grass
and a hedge of sumach and sassafras
with bluebirds twittering all around
these, and the little house where i was born
low and little, and black and old
with children, many as it can hold
all at the windows, open wide
heads and shoulders clear outside
and fair young faces all ablush
perhaps you have seen, some day
roses crowding the self-same way
out of a wilding, wayside bush

listen closer. when you have done
with woods and cornfields and grazing herds
a lady, the loveliest ever the sun
looked down upon you must paint for me
oh, if i could only make you see
the clear blue eyes, the tender smile
the sovereign sweetness, the gentle grace
the woman's soul, and the angel's face
that are beaming on me all the while
i need not speak these foolish words
yet one word tells you all i would say
she is my mother: you will agree
that all the rest may be thrown away

two little urchins at her knee
you must paint, sir: one like me
the other with a clearer brow
and the light of his adventurous eyes
flashing with boldest enterprise
at ten years old he went to sea
god knoweth if he be living now
he sailed in the good ship "commodore
nobody ever crossed her track
to bring us news, and she never came back
ah, it is twenty long years and more
since that old ship went out of the bay
with my great-hearted brother on her deck
i watched him till he shrank to a speck
and his face was toward me all the way
bright his hair was, a golden brown
the time we stood at our mother's knee
that beauteous head, if it did go down
carried sunshine into the sea

out in the fields one summer night
we were together, half afraid
of the corn-leaves' rustling, and of the shade
of the high hills, stretching so still and far
loitering till after the low little light
of the candle shone through the open door
and over the hay-stack's pointed top
all of a tremble and ready to drop
the first half-hoar, the great yellow star
that we, with staring, ignorant eyes
had often and often watched to see
propped and held in its place in the skies
by the fork of a tall red mulberry-tree
which close in the edge of our flax-field grew
dead at the top, just one branch full
of leaves, notched round, and lined with wool
from which it tenderly shook the dew
over our heads, when we came to play
in its hand-breadth of shadow, day after day
afraid to go home, sir; for one of us bore
a nest full of speckled and thin-shelled eggs
the other, a bird, held fast by the legs
not so big as a straw of wheat
the berries we gave her she wouldn't eat
but cried and cried, till we held her bill
so slim and shining, to keep her still

at last we stood at our mother's knee
do you think, sir, if you try
you can paint the look of a lie
if you can, pray have the grace
to put it solely in the face
of the urchin that is likest me
i think 'twas solely mine, indeed
but that's no matter,--paint it so
the eyes of our mother--(take good heed
looking not on the nestful of eggs
nor the fluttering bird, held so fast by the legs
but straight through our faces down to our lies
and, oh, with such injured, reproachful surprise
i felt my heart bleed where that glance went, as though
a sharp blade struck through it

you, sir, know
that you on the canvas are to repeat
things that are fairest, things most sweet
woods and cornfields and mulberry-tree
the mother,--the lads, with their bird at her knee
but, oh, that look of reproachful woe
high as the heavens your name i'll shout
if you paint me the picture, and leave that out



who won the war
of ruthless hordes who thought to ride
her borders through and prostrate france
ere yet she'd time to raise her lance

who won the war
italia broke the galling chain
which bound her to the guilty twain
then fought 'gainst odds till one of these
lay prone and shattered at her knees

who won the war
old england's watch dogs of the main
their vigil kept, and not in vain
for not a ship their wrath dared brave
save those which skulked beneath the wave

who won the war
the grandest words on history's page
and he could never pass verdun

who won the war
in darkest hour there rose a cry
thank god! they came across the sea
two million men and victory

who won the war
no one of these; not one, but all
who answered freedom's clarion call
each humble man who did his bit
in god's own book of fame is writ
these won the war



the bravest battle that ever was fought
shall i tell you where and when
on the map of the world you will find it not

nay, not with cannon or battle shot
with sword or nobler pen
nay, not with eloquent words or thought
from mouths of wonderful men

but deep in the walled-up woman's heart
of woman that would not yield
but bravely, silently, bore her part
lo, there is the battle field

no marshaling troup, no bivouac song
no banner to gleam or wave
but oh, these battles, they last so long
from babyhood to the grave

yet, faithful as a bridge of stars
she fights in her walled-up town
fights on and on in the endless wars
then, silent, unseen, goes down

oh, ye with banner and battle shot
and soldiers to shout and praises
i tell you the kingliest victories fought
were fought in those silent ways

oh, spotless in a world of shame
with splendid and silent scorn
go back to god as white as you came
the kingliest warrior born



bob went lookin' for a job
didn't want a situation; didn't ask a lofty station
didn't have a special mission for a topnotcher's position
didn't have such fine credentials--but he had the real essentials
had a head that kept on workin' and two hands that were not shirkin
wasn't either shirk or snob
wasn't mister--just plain bob
who was lookin' for a job

bob went lookin' for a job
and he wasn't scared or daunted when he saw a sign--"men wanted
walked right in with manner fittin' up to where the boss was sittin
and he said: "my name is bob, and i'm lookin' for a job
and if you're the boss that hires 'em, starts 'em working and that
fires 'em
put my name right down here, neighbor, as a candidate for labor
for my name is just plain 'bob
and my pulses sort o' throb
for that thing they call a job
bob kept askin' for a job
and the boss, he says: "what kind?" and bob answered:  "never mind
for i am not a bit partic'ler and i never was a stickler
for proprieties in workin'--if you got some labor lurkin
anywhere around about kindly go and trot it out
it's, a job i want, you see
any kind that there may be
will be good enough for me

well, sir, bob he got a job
but the boss went 'round all day in a dreamy sort of way
and he says to me: "by thunder, we have got the world's eighth wonder
got a feller name of bob who just asked me for a job
never asks when he engages about overtime in wages
never asked if he'd get pay by the hour or by the day
never asked me if it's airy work and light and sanitary
never asked me for my notion of the chances of promotion
never asked for the duration of his annual vacation
never asked for saturday half-a-holiday with pay
never took me on probation till he tried the situation
never asked me if it's sittin' work or standin', or befittin
of his birth and inclination--he just filed his application
hung his coat up on a knob
said his name was just plain bob
and went workin' at a job



whatever i do and whatever i say
aunt tabitha tells me it isn't the way
when _she_ was a girl (forty summers ago
aunt tabitha tells me they never did so

dear aunt! if i only would take her advice
but i like my own way, and i find it _so_ nice
and besides, i forget half the things i am told
but they all will come back to me--when i am old

if a youth passes by, it may happen, no doubt
he may chance to look in as i chance to look out
it is _horrid_, she says, and i mustn't sit there

a walk in the moonlight has pleasures, i own
but it isn't quite safe to be walking alone
so i take a lad's arm--just for safety you know
but aunt tabitha tells me _they_ didn't do so

how wicked we are, and how good they were then
they kept at arm's length those detestable men
what an era of virtue she lived in!--but stay
were the _men_ all such rogues in aunt tabitha's day

if the men _were_ so wicked, i'll ask my papa
how he dared to propose to my darling mamma
was he like the rest of them? goodness! who knows
and what shall _i_ say, if a wretch should propose

i am thinking if aunt knew so little of sin
what a wonder aunt tabitha's aunt must have been
and her grand-aunt--it scares me--how shockingly sad
that we girls of to-day are so frightfully bad

a martyr will save us, and nothing else can
let _me perish_--to rescue some wretched young man
though when to the altar a victim i go
aunt tabitha'll tell me _she_ never did so


hats off
along the street there comes
a blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums
a flash of color beneath the sky
hats off
the flag is passing by

blue and crimson and white it shines
over the steel-tipped, ordered lines
hats off
the colors before us fly
but more than the flag is passing by

sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great
fought to make and to save the state
weary marches and sinking ships
cheers of victory on dying lips

days of plenty and years of peace
march of a strong land's swift increase
equal justice, right and law
stately honor and reverent awe

sign of a nation, great and strong
to ward her people from foreign wrong
pride and glory and honor, all
live in the colors to stand or fall

hats off
along the street there comes
a blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums
and loyal hearts are beating high
hats off
the flag is passing by



the rivers of france are ten score and twain
but five are the names that we know
the marne, the vesle, the oureq and the aisne
and the somme of the swampy flow

the rivers of france, from source to sea
are nourished by many a rill
but these five, if ever a drouth there be
the fountains of sorrow would fill

the rivers of france shine silver white
but the waters of five are red
with the richest blood, in the fiercest fight
for freedom that ever was shed

the rivers of france sing soft as they run
but five have a song of their own
that hymns the fall of the arrogant one
and the proud cast down from his throne

the rivers of france all quietly take
to sleep in the house of their birth
but the carnadined wave of five shall break
on the uttermost strands of earth

five rivers of france--see! their names are writ
on a banner of crimson and gold
and the glory of those who fashioned it
shall nevermore cease to be told



there's no dew left on the daisies and clover
there's no rain left in heaven
i've said my "seven times" over and over
seven times one are seven

i am old, so old i can write a letter
my birthday lessons are done
the lambs play always, they know no better
they are only one times one

o moon! in the night i have seen you sailing
and shining so round and low
you were bright! but your light is failing
you are nothing now but a bow

you moon, have you done something wrong in heaven
that god has hidden your face
i hope if you have, you'll soon be forgiven
and shine again in your place

o velvet bee, you're a dusty fellow
you've powdered your legs with gold
o brave marshmary buds, rich and yellow
give me your money to hold

o columbine, open your folded wrapper
where two twin turtle-doves dwell
o cuckoo-pint, toll me the purple clapper
that hangs in your clear green bell

and show me your nest, with the young ones in it
i will not steal them away
i am old! you may trust me, linnet, linnet
i am seven times one to-day



you bells in the steeple, ring, ring out your changes
how many soever they be
and let the brown meadow-lark's note as he ranges
come over, come over to me

yet birds' clearest carol by fall or by swelling
no magical sense conveys
and bells have forgotten their old art of telling
the fortune of future days

while a boy listened alone
made his heart yearn again, musing so wearily
all by himself on a stone

poor bells! i forgive you; your good days are over
and mine, they are yet to be
no listening, no longing shall aught, aught discover
you leave the story to me

the foxglove shoots out of the green matted heather
preparing her hoods of snow
she was idle, and slept till the sunshiny weather
oh, children take long to grow

i wish and i wish that the spring would go faster
nor long summer bide so late
and i could grow on like the foxglove and aster
for some things are ill to wait

i wait for the day when dear hearts shall discover
while dear hands are laid on my head
for all the lessons are said

i wait for my story--the birds cannot sing it
not one, as he sits on the tree
the bells cannot ring it, but long years, oh bring it
such as i wish it to be




i leaned out of window, i smelt the white clover
dark, dark was the garden, i saw not the gate
hush, nightingale, hush! o sweet nightingale, wait
till i listen and hear
if a step draweth near
for my love he is late

a cluster of stars hangs like fruit in the tree
the fall of the water comes sweeter, comes clearer
to what art thou listening, and what dost thou see
let the star-clusters grow
let the sweet waters flow
and cross quickly to me

from sycamore blossoms, or settle or sleep
you glowworms, shine out, and the pathway discover
to him that comes darkling along the rough steep
ah, my sailor, make haste
for the time runs to waste
and my love lieth deep

i've conned thee an answer, it waits thee to-night
by the sycamore passed he, and through the white clover
then all the sweet speech i had fashioned took flight
but i'll love him more, more
than e'er wife loved before
be the days dark or bright




heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups
fair yellow daffodils, stately and tall
when the wind wakes, how they rock in the grasses
and dance with the cuckoo-buds slender and small
here's two bonny boys, and here's mother's own lasses
eager to gather them all

heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups
mother shall thread them a daisy chain
sing them a song of the pretty hedge-sparrow
that loved her brown little ones, loved them full fain
sing, "heart, thou art wide though the house be but narrow
sing once, and sing it again

heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups
sweet wagging cowslips, they bend and they bow
a ship sails afar over warm ocean waters
and haply one musing doth stand at her prow
o bonny brown son, and o sweet little daughters
maybe he thinks on you now

heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups
fair yellow daffodils, stately and tall
a sunshiny world full of laughter and leisure
and fresh hearts unconscious of sorrow and thrall
send down on their pleasure smiles passing its measure
god that is over us all



ere, in the northern gale
the summer tresses of the trees are gone
the woods of autumn, all around our vale
have put their glory on

the mountains that infold
in their wide sweep, the colored landscape round
seem groups of giant kings, in purple and gold
that guard the enchanted ground

i roam the woods that crown
the upland, where the mingled splendors glow
where the gay company of trees look down
on the green fields below

my steps are not alone
in these bright walks; the sweet southwest, at play
flies, rustling, where the painted leaves are strown
along the winding way

and far in heaven, the while
the sun, that sends that gale to wander here
pours out on the fair earth his quiet smile
the sweetest of the year

where now the solemn shade
verdure and gloom where many branches meet
so grateful, when the noon of summer made
the valleys sick with heat

let in through all the trees
come the strange rays; the forest depths are bright
their sunny-colored foliage, in the breeze
twinkles, like beams of light

the rivulet, late unseen
where bickering through the shrubs its waters run
shines with the image of its golden screen
and glimmerings of the sun

but 'neath yon crimson tree
lover to listening maid might breathe his flame
nor mark, within its roseate canopy
her blush of maiden shame

oh, autumn! why so soon
depart the hues that make thy forests glad
thy gentle wind and thy fair sunny noon
and leave thee wild and sad

ah! 'twere a lot too blessed
forever in thy colored shades to stray
amid the kisses of the soft southwest
to rove and dream for aye

and leave the vain low strife
that makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power
the passions and the cares that wither life
and waste its little hour



did you ever hear of the drummer boy of mission ridge, who lay
with his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, in the charge of
that terrible day
they were firing above him and firing below, and the tempest of shot
and shell
was raging like death, as he moaned in his pain, by the breastworks
where he fell

moment when
he might follow the ranks and shoulder a gun with the best of us
bearded men
and so when the signals from old fort wood set an army of veterans wild
he flung down his drum, which spun down the hill like the ball of a
wayward child

as we charged by the flank, with our colors ahead, and our columns
in the long, swinging lines of that splendid advance, when the flags
of our corps floated out
like the ribbons that dance in the jubilant lines of the march of a
gala day rout

he charged with the ranks, though he carried no gun, for the colonel
had said him nay
and he breasted the blast of the bristling guns, and the shock of the
sickening fray
and when by his side they were falling like hail he sprang to a comrade
slain
and shouldered his musket and bore it as true as the hand that was dead
in pain

black eye
that flashed forth a spirit too great for his form--he only was just so
as tall, perhaps, as your little lad who scarcely reaches your shoulder
though his heart was the heart of a veteran then, a trifle, it may be
bolder

he pressed to the front, our lad so leal, and the works were almost won
a moment more and our flags had swung o'er the muzzle of murderous gun
but a raking fire swept the van, and he fell 'mid the wounded and slain
with his wee wan face turned up to him who feeleth his children's pain

again and again our lines fell back, and again with shivering shocks
they flung themselves on the rebels' works as ships are tossed on rocks
to be crushed and broken and scattered amain, as the wrecks of the
surging storm
where none may rue and none may reck of aught that has human form

so under the ridge we were lying for the order to charge again
and we counted our comrades missing, and we counted our comrades slain
and one said, "johnny, our drummer boy, is grievously shot and lies
just under the enemy's breastwork; if left on the field he dies

then all the blood that was in me  surged up to my aching brow
and my heart leaped up like a ball in my throat--i can feel it even now
and i said i would bring that boy from the field, if god would spare my
breath
if all the guns in mission ridge should thunder the threat of death

i crept and crept up the ghastly ridge, by the wounded and the dead
with the moans of my comrades right and left, behind me and yet ahead
till i came to the form of our drummer boy, in his blouse of dusty blue
with his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, where the blast of
the battle blew

and his gaze as he met my own just there would have melted a heart of
stone
as he tried like a wounded bird to rise, and placed his hand in my own
and he said in a voice half smothered, though its whispering thrills
me yet

the men go up those breastworks there, just stop and waken me
for though i cannot make the charge  and join the cheers that rise
i may forget my pain to see the old flag kiss the skies

well, it was hard to treat him so, his poor limb shattered sore
but i raised him on my shoulder and to the surgeon bore
and the boys who saw us coming each gave a shout of joy
and uttered fervent prayers for him, our valiant drummer boy

when sped the news that "fighting joe" had saved the union right
with his legions fresh from lookout; and that thomas massed his might
and forced the rebel center; and our cheering ran like wild
and sherman's heart was happy as the heart of a little child

when grant from his lofty outlook saw our flags by the hundred fly
along the slopes of mission ridge, where'er he cast his eye
and when we heard the thrilling news of the mighty battle done
the fearful contest ended, and the glorious victory won

then his bright black eyes so yearning grew strangely rapt and wide
and in that hour of conquest our little hero died
but ever in our hearts he dwells, with a grace that ne'er is old
for him the heart to duty wed can nevermore grow cold

and when they tell of heroes, and the laurels they have won
of the scars they are doomed to carry, of the deeds that they have done
of the horror to be biding among the ghastly dead
the gory sod beneath them, the bursting shell o'erhead

my heart goes back to mission ridge and the drummer boy who lay
with his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, in the charge of
that terrible day
and i say that the land that bears such sons is crowned and dowered
with all
the dear god giveth nations to stay them lest they fall

oh, glory of mission ridge, stream on, like the roseate light of morn
on the sons that now are living, on the sons that are yet unborn
and cheers for our comrades living, and tears as they pass away
and three times three for the drummer boy who fought at the front that


if you can keep your head when all about you
are losing theirs and blaming it on you
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
but make allowance for their doubting too
if you can wait and not be tired by waiting
or being lied about don't deal in lies
or being hated don't give way to hating
and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise

if you can dream and not make dreams your master
if you can think and not make thoughts your aim
if you can meet with triumph and disaster
and treat those two impostors just the same
if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
or watch the things you gave your life to broken
and stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools

if you can make one heap of all your winnings
and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss
and lose, and start again at your beginnings
and never breathe a word about your loss
if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
to serve your turn long after they are gone
and so hold on when there is nothing in you
except the will which says to them: "hold on

if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue
or walk with kings nor lose the common touch
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you
if all men count with you, but none too much
if you can fill the unforgiving minute
with sixty seconds' worth of distance run
yours is the earth and everything that's in it
and--which is more--you'll be a man, my son



some boys are mad when comp'ny comes to stay for meals. they hate
to have the other people eat while boys must wait and wait
but i've about made up my mind i'm different from the rest
for as for me, i b'lieve i like the second table best

to eat along with comp'ny is so trying, for it's tough
to sit and watch the victuals when you dassent touch the stuff
you see your father serving out the dark meat and the light
until a boy is sure he'll starve before he gets a bite

and when, he asks you what you'll have,--you've heard it all before
you know you'll get just what you get and won't get nothing more
for, when you want another piece, your mother winks her eye
and so you say, "i've plenty, thanks!" and tell a whopping lie

when comp'ny is a-watching you, you've got to be polite
and eat your victuals with a fork and take a little bite
you can't have nothing till you're asked and, 'cause a boy is small
folks think he isn't hungry, and he's never asked at all

since i can first remember i've been told that when the cake
is passed around, the proper thing is for a boy to take
the piece that's nearest to him, and so all i ever got
when comp'ny's been to our house, was the smallest in the lot

it worries boys like everything to have the comp'ny stay
a-setting round the table, like they couldn't get away
but when they've gone, and left the whole big shooting match to me
say! ain't it fun to just wade in and help myself? oh, gee

with no one round to notice what you're doing--bet your life
boys don't use forks to eat with when they'd rather use a knife
nor take such little bites as when they're eating with the rest
and so, for lots of things, i like the second table best



when the lessons and tasks are all ended
and the school for the day is dismissed
and the little ones gather around me
to bid me good night and be kissed
oh, the little white arms that encircle
my neck in their tender embrace
oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven
shedding sunshine of love on my face

and when they are gone, i sit dreaming
of my childhood, too lovely to last
of love that my heart will remember
when it wakes to the pulse of the past
ere the world and its wickedness made me
a partner of sorrow and sin
when the glory of god was about me
and the glory of gladness within

all my heart grows weak as a woman's
and the fountains of feeling will flow
when i think of the paths steep and stony
where the feet of the dear ones must go
of the mountains of sin hanging o'er them
of the tempest of fate blowing wild
oh, there's nothing on earth half so holy
as the innocent heart of a child

they are idols of hearts and of households
they are angels of god in disguise
his sunlight still sleeps in their tresses
his glory still gleams in their eyes
oh, these truants from home and from heaven
they have made me more manly and mild
and i know now how jesus could liken
the kingdom of god to a child

i ask not a life for the dear ones
all radiant, as others have done
but that life may have just enough shadow
to temper the glare of the sun
i would pray god to guard them from evil
but my prayer would bound back to myself
ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner
but a sinner must pray for himself

the twig is so easily bended
i have banished the rule and the rod
i have taught them the goodness of knowledge
they have taught me the goodness of god
my heart is the dungeon of darkness
where i shut them for breaking a rule
my frown is sufficient correction
my love is the law of the school

i shall leave the old house in the autumn
to traverse its threshold no more
ah! how shall i sigh for the dear ones
that meet me each morn at the door
i shall miss the "good nights" and the kisses
and the gush of their innocent glee
the group on its green, and the flowers
that are brought every morning to me

i shall miss them at morn and at even
their song in the school and the street
i shall miss the low hum of their voices
and the tread of their delicate feet
when the lessons of life are all ended
and death says, "the school is dismissed
may the little ones gather around me
to bid me good night and be kissed



not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
in hopes that st. nicholas soon would be there
the children were nestled all snug in their beds
while visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads
and mamma in her kerchief, and i in my cap
had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap
when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
i sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
away to the window i flew like a flash
tore open the shutters and threw up the sash
the moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow
gave a luster of midday to objects below
when what to my wondering eyes should appear
but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer
with a little old driver, so lively and quick
i knew in a moment it must be st. nick
more rapid than eagles his coursers they came
and he whistled and shouted, and called them by name
on, comet, on, cupid! on, donder and blitzen
to the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
now, dash away, dash sway, dash away all
as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky
so, up to the house-top the coursers they flew
with the sleigh full of toys, and st. nicholas too
and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof
as i drew in my head, and was turning around
down the chimney st. nicholas came with a bound
he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
a bundle of toys he had flung on his back
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack
his eyes how they twinkled; his dimples how merry
his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow
the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath
he had a broad face and a little round belly
that shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly
he was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf
and i laughed when i saw him, in spite of myself
a wink of his eye, and a twist of his head
soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread
he spake not a word, but went straight to his work
and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk
and laying his finger aside of his nose
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose
he sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle
and away they all flew like the down of a thistle
but i heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight



if you cannot on the ocean
sail among the swiftest fleet
rocking on the highest billows
laughing at the storms you meet
you can stand among the sailors
anchored yet within the bay
you can lend a hand to help them
as they launch their boats away

if you are too weak to journey
up the mountain steep and high
you can stand within the valley
while the multitudes go by
you can chant in happy measure
as they slowly pass along
though they may forget the singer
they will not forget the song

if you have not gold and silver
ever ready to command
if you cannot towards the needy
reach an ever-open hand
you can visit the afflicted
o'er the erring you can weep
you can be a true disciple
sitting at the savior's feet

if you cannot in the conflict
prove yourself a soldier true
if where fire and smoke are thickest
there's no work for you to do
when the battle-field is silent
you can go with careful tread
you can bear away the wounded
you can cover up the dead

do not then stand idly waiting
for some greater work to do
fortune is a lazy goddess
she will never come to you
go and toil in any vineyard
do not fear to do or dare
if you want a field of labor
you can find it anywhere



there are hermit souls that live withdrawn
in the peace of their self-content
there are souls, like stars, that dwell apart
in a fellowless firmament
there are pioneer souls that blaze their paths
where highways never ran
but let me live by the side of the road
and be a friend to man

let me live in a house by the side of the road
where the race of men go by
the men who are good and the men who are bad
i would not sit in the scorner's seat
or hurl the cynic's ban
let me live in a house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man

i see from my house by the side of the road
by the side of the highway of life
the men who press with the ardor of hope
the men who are faint with the strife
but i turn not away from their smiles nor their tears
both parts of an infinite plan
let me live in my house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man

i know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead
and mountains of wearisome height
that the road passes on through the long afternoon
and stretches away to the night
but still i rejoice when the travelers rejoice
and weep with the strangers that moan
nor live in my house by the side of the road
like a man who dwells alone

let me live in my house by the side of the road
where the race of men go by
they are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong
then why should i sit in the scorner's seat
or hurl the cynic's ban
let me live in my house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man



the first thing that i remember was carlo tugging away
with the sleeve of my coat fast in his teeth, pulling, as much as to
think of the souls in the coming train, and the graves you are sending
them to
think of the mother and the babe at her breast, think of the father and
think of the lover and the loved one too, think of them doomed every one
to fall (as it were by your very hand) into yon fathomless ditch
murdered by one who should guard them from harm, who now lies asleep at
the switch

i sprang up amazed--scarce knew where i stood, sleep had o'ermastered
me so
i could hear the wind hollowly howling, and the deep river dashing below
i could hear the forest leaves rustling, as the trees by the tempest were
fanned
but what was that noise in the distance? that, i could not understand
i heard it at first indistinctly, like the rolling of some muffled drum
then nearer and nearer it came to me, till it made my very ears hum
what is this light that surrounds me and seems to set fire to my brain
what whistle's that, yelling so shrill? ah! i know now; it's the train

we often stand facing some danger, and seem to take root to the place
so i stood--with this demon before me, its heated breath scorching my
its headlight made day of the darkness, and glared like the eyes of
some witch
the train was almost upon me before i remembered the switch
i sprang to it, seizing it wildly, the train dashing fast down the track
the switch resisted my efforts, some devil seemed holding it back
on, on came the fiery-eyed monster, and shot by my face like a flash
i swooned to the earth the next moment, and knew nothing after the crash

how long i lay there unconscious 'twas impossible for me to tell
my stupor was almost a heaven, my waking almost a hell
for then i heard the piteous moaning and shrieking of husbands and wives
and i thought of the day we all shrink from, when i must account for
their lives
mothers rushed by me like maniacs, their eyes glaring madly and wild
fathers, losing their courage, gave way to their grief like a child
children searching for parents, i noticed, as by me they sped
and lips, that could form naught but "mamma," were calling for one
perhaps dead

my mind was made up in a moment, the river should hide me away
when, under the still burning rafters i suddenly noticed there lay
a little white hand; she who owned it was doubtless an object of love
to one whom her loss would drive frantic, though she guarded him now
from above
i tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid them one side
how little she thought of her journey when she left for this dark, fatal
i lifted the last log from off her, and while searching for some spark
of life
turned her little face up in the starlight, and recognized--maggie, my

o lord! my scourge is a hard one, at a blow thou hast shattered my pride
my life will be one endless nightmare, with maggie away from my side
how often i'd sat down and pictured the scenes in our long, happy life
how i'd strive through all my lifetime, to build up a home for my wife
how people would envy us always in our cozy and neat little nest
how i should do all the labor, and maggie should all the day rest
how one of god's blessings might cheer us, how some day i perhaps should
be rich
but all of my dreams had been shattered, while i lay there asleep at the
switch

i fancied i stood on my trial, the jury and judge i could see
and every eye in the court room was steadily fixed upon me
and fingers were pointed in scorn, till i felt my face blushing blood-red
and the next thing i heard were the words, "hanged by the neck until
then i felt myself pulled once again, and my hand caught tight hold of a
dress
guess
and there stood maggie, my wife, with never a scar from the ditch
i'd been taking a nap in my bed, and had not been "asleep at the switch



a fire-mist and a planet
a crystal and a cell
a jellyfish and a saurian
and caves where the cavemen dwell
then a sense of law and beauty
and a face turned from the clod
some call it evolution
and others call it god

a haze in the far horizon
the infinite, tender sky
the ripe, rich tints of the cornfields
and the wild geese sailing high
and all over upland and lowland
the charm of the goldenrod
some of us call it nature
and others call it god

like tides on a crescent sea-beach
when the moon is new and thin
into our hearts high yearnings
come welling and surging in
come from the mystic ocean
whose rim no foot has trod
some of us call it longing
and others call it god

a picket frozen on duty
a mother starved for her brood
socrates drinking the hemlock
and jesus on the rood
the millions who, humble and nameless
the straight, hard pathway trod
some call it consecration
and others call it god



come, listen all unto my song
it is no silly fable
they call the atlantic cable

bold cyrus field he said, says he
i have a pretty notion
that i can run the telegraph
across the atlantic ocean

then all the people laughed, and said
they'd like to see him do it
he might get half-seas over, but
he never could go through it

to carry out his foolish plan
he never would be able
he might as well go hang himself
with his atlantic cable

but cyrus was a valiant man
a fellow of decision
and heeded not their mocking words
their laughter and derision

twice did his bravest efforts fail
and yet his mind was stable
he wa'n't the man to break his heart
because he broke his cable


once more they tried--hurrah! hurrah
what means this great commotion
the lord be praised! the cable's laid
across the atlantic ocean

loud ring the bells,--for, flashing through
six hundred leagues of water
old mother england's benison
salutes her eldest daughter

o'er all the land the tidings speed
and soon, in every nation
they'll hear about the cable with
profoundest admiration

the manly, bold, and stable
and tell our sons, to make them brave
how cyrus laid the cable



jane jones keeps talkin' to me all the time
an' says you must make it a rule
to study your lessons 'nd work hard 'nd learn
an' never be absent from school
remember the story of elihu burritt
an' how he clum up to the top
got all the knowledge 'at he ever had
down in a blacksmithing shop
jane jones she honestly said it was so
mebbe he did
i dunno
o' course what's a-keepin' me 'way from the top
is not never havin' no blacksmithing shop

she said 'at ben franklin was awfully poor
but full of ambition an' brains
an' studied philosophy all his hull life
an' see what he got for his pains
he brought electricity out of the sky
with a kite an' a bottle an' key
an' we're owing him more'n any one else
for all the bright lights 'at we see
jane jones she honestly said it was so
mebbe he did
i dunno
o' course what's allers been hinderin' me
is not havin' any kite, lightning er key

jane jones said abe lincoln had no books at all
an' used to split rails when a boy
an' general grant was a tanner by trade
an' lived 'way out in illinois
so when the great war in the south first broke out
he stood on the side o' the right
an' when lincoln called him to take charge o' things
he won nearly every blamed fight
jane jones she honestly said it was so
mebbe he did
i dunno
still i ain't to blame, not by a big sight
for i ain't never had any battles to fight

she said 'at columbus was out at the knees
when he first thought up his big scheme
an' told all the spaniards 'nd italians, too
an' all of 'em said 'twas a dream
but queen isabella jest listened to him
mebbe he did
i dunno
o' course that may be, but then you must allow
they ain't no land to discover jest now



mounted on kyrat strong and fleet
his chestnut steed with four white feet
roushan beg, called kurroglou
son of the road and bandit chief
seeking refuge and relief
up the mountain pathway flew

such was kyrat's wondrous speed
never yet could any steed
reach the dust-cloud in his course
more than maiden, more than wife
more than gold and next to life
roushan the robber loved his horse

in the land that lies beyond
erzeroum and trebizond
garden-girt his fortress stood
plundered khan, or caravan
journeying north from koordistan
gave him wealth and wine and food

seven hundred and fourscore
men at arms his livery wore
did his bidding night and day
now, through regions all unknown
he was wandering, lost, alone
seeking without guide his way

suddenly the pathway ends
sheer the precipice descends
loud the torrent roars unseen
thirty feet from side to side
yawns the chasm; on air must ride
he who crosses this ravine

following close in his pursuit
at the precipice's foot
reyhan the arab of orfah
halted with his hundred men
shouting upward from the glen

gently roushan beg caressed
kyrat's forehead, neck, and breast
kissed him upon both his eyes
sang to him in his wild way
as upon the topmost spray
sings a bird before it flies

round and slender as a reed
carry me this peril through
satin housings shall be thine
shoes of gold, o kyrat mine
o thou soul of kurroglou

soft as woman's hair thy mane
tender are thine eyes and true
all thy hoofs like ivory shine
polished bright; o life of mine
leap, and rescue kurroglou

kyrat, then, the strong and fleet
drew together his four white feet
paused a moment on the verge
measured with his eye the space
and into the air's embrace
leaped, as leaps the ocean surge

as the ocean surge o'er sand
bears a swimmer safe to land
kyrat safe his rider bore
rattling down the deep abyss
fragments of the precipice
rolled like pebbles on a shore

roushan's tasseled cap of red
trembled not upon his head
careless sat he and upright
neither hand nor bridle shook
nor his head he turned to look
as he galloped out of sight

flash of harness in the air
seen a moment like the glare
of a sword drawn from its sheath
thus the phantom horseman passed
and the shadow that he cast
leaped the cataract underneath

reyhan the arab held his breath
while this vision of life and death
passed above him. "allahu
cried he. "in all koordistan
lives there not so brave a man
as this robber kurroglou



ay, tear her tattered ensign down
long has it waved on high
and many an eye has danced to see
that banner in the sky
beneath it rung the battle shout
and burst the cannon's roar
the meteor of the ocean air
shall sweep the clouds no more

her deck, once red with heroes' blood
where knelt the vanquished foe
when winds were hurrying o'er the flood
and waves were white below
no more shall feel the victor's tread
or know the conquered knee
the harpies of the shore shall pluck
the eagle of the sea

oh, better that her shattered hulk
should sink beneath the wave
her thunders shook the mighty deep
and there should be her grave
nail to the mast her holy flag
set every threadbare sail
and give her to the god of storms
the lightning and the gale



tell me not, in mournful numbers
for the soul is dead that slumbers
and things are not what they seem

life is real! life is earnest
and the grave is not its goal
was not spoken of the soul

not enjoyment, and not sorrow
is our destined end or way
but to act that each to-morrow
finds us farther than to-day

art is long, and time is fleeting
and our hearts, though stout and brave
still, like muffled drums, are beating
funeral marches to the grave

in the world's broad field of battle
in the bivouac of life
be not like dumb, driven cattle
be a hero in the strife

trust no future, howe'er pleasant
let the dead past bury its dead
act, act in the living present
heart within, and god o'erhead

lives of great men all remind us
we can make our lives sublime
and, departing, leave behind us
footprints on the sands of time

footprints, that perhaps another
sailing o'er life's solemn main
a forlorn and shipwrecked brother
seeing, shall take heart again

let us, then, be up and doing
with a heart for any fate
still achieving, still pursuing
learn to labor and to wait

singing through the forests, rattling over ridges
shooting under arches, rumbling over bridges
whizzing through the mountains, buzzing o'er the vale
bless me! this is pleasant, riding on the rail

men of different stations in the eye of fame
here are very quickly coming to the same
high and lowly people, birds of every feather
on a common level, traveling together

gentlemen in shorts, blooming very tall
gentlemen at large, talking very small
gentlemen in tights, with a loosish mien
gentlemen in gray, looking very green

gentlemen quite old, asking for the news
gentlemen in black, with a fit of blues
gentlemen in claret, sober as a vicar
gentlemen in tweed, dreadfully in liquor

stranger on the right looking very sunny
obviously reading something very funny
now the smiles are thicker--wonder what they mean
faith, he's got the knickerbocker magazine

stranger on the left, closing up his peepers
now he snores again, like the seven sleepers
at his feet a volume gives the explanation
how the man grew stupid from "association

ancient maiden lady anxiously remarks
that there must be peril 'mong so many sparks
roguish-looking fellow, turning to the stranger
says 'tis his opinion _she_ is out of danger

woman with her baby, sitting _vis a vis
baby keeps a-squalling, woman looks at me
asks about the distance--says 'tis tiresome talking
noises of the cars are so very shocking

market woman, careful of the precious casket
knowing eggs are eggs, tightly holds her basket
feeling that a smash, if it came, would surely
send her eggs to pot rather prematurely

singing through the forests, rattling over ridges
shooting under arches, rumbling over bridges
whizzing through the mountains, buzzing o'er the vale
bless me! this is pleasant, riding on the rail




thou, too, sail on, o ship of state
sail on, o union, strong and great
humanity with all its fears
with all the hopes of future years
is hanging breathless on thy fate
we know what master laid thy keel
what workmen wrought thy ribs of steel
who made each mast, and sail, and rope
what anvils rang, what hammers beat
in what a forge and what a heat
were shaped the anchors of thy hope
fear not each sudden sound and shock
and not a rent made by the gale
in spite of rock and tempest's roar
in spite of false lights on the shore
sail on, nor fear to breast the sea
our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee
our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears
our faith truiumphant o'er our fears
are all with thee,--are all with thee

the barber was busy, and he couldn't stop
the customers, waiting their turns, were all reading
the _daily_, the _herald_, the _post_, little heeding
the young man who blurted out such a blunt question
not one raised a head, or even made a suggestion
and the barber kept on shaving

cried the youth, with a frown
how preposterous each wing is
how flattened the head is, how jammed down the neck is
in short, the whole owl, what an ignorant wreck 'tis
i make no apology; i've learned owleology
i've passed days and nights in a hundred collections
and cannot be blinded to any deflections
arising from unskilful fingers that fail
to stuff a bird right, from his beak to his tail
mister brown! mister brown! do take that bird down
or you'll soon be the laughing-stock all over town
and the barber kept on shaving

and other night fowls
and i tell you
what i know to be true
an owl cannot roost
with his limbs so unloosed
no owl in this world
ever had his claws curled
ever had his legs slanted
ever had his bill canted
ever had his neck screwed
into that attitude
he can't _do_ it, because
anatomy teaches
ornithology preaches
an owl has a toe
that _can't_ turn out so
i've made the white owl my study for years
and to see such a job almost moves me to tears
mister brown, i'm amazed
you should be so gone crazed
as to put up a bird
in that posture absurd
to _look_ at that owl really brings on a dizziness
the man who stuffed him don't half know his business
and the barber kept on shaving

i'm filled with surprise
taxidermists should pass
off on you such poor glass
so unnatural they seem
they'd make audubon scream
and john burroughs laugh
to encounter such chaff
do take that bird down
have him stuffed again, brown
and the barber kept on shaving

i could stuff in the dark
an owl better than that
i could make an old hat
look more like an owl
than that horrid fowl
stuck up here so stiff like a side of coarse leather
in fact, about _him _there's not one natural feather
just then, with a wink and a sly normal lurch
the owl, very gravely, got down from his perch
walked round, and regarded his fault-finding critic
and then fairly hooted, as if he should say
don't waste it again on a live bird, i pray
i'm an owl; you're another. sir critic, good-day
and the barber kept on shaving



the end has come, as come it must
to all things; in these sweet june days
the teacher and the scholar trust
their parting feet to separate ways

they part: but in the years to be
shall pleasant memories cling to each
as shells bear inland from the sea
the murmur of the rhythmic beach

one knew the joys the sculptor knows
when, plastic to his lightest touch
his clay-wrought model slowly grows
to that fine grace desired so much

so daily grew before her eyes
the living shapes whereon she wrought
strong, tender, innocently wise
the child's heart with the woman's thought

and one shall never quite forget
the voice that called from dream and play
the firm but kindly hand that set
her feet in learning's pleasant way

the joy of undine soul-possessed
the wakening sense, the strange delight
that swelled the fabled statue's breast
and filled its clouded eyes with sight

o youth and beauty, loved of all
ye pass from girlhood's gate of dreams
in broader ways your footsteps fall
ye test the truth of all that seems

her little realm the teacher leaves
she breaks her wand of power apart
while, for your love and trust, she gives
the warm thanks of a grateful heart

hers is the sober summer noon
contrasted with your morn of spring
the waning with the waxing moon
the folded with the outspread wing

across the distance of the years
she sends her god-speed back to you
she has no thought of doubts or fears
be but yourselves, be pure, be true

and prompt in duty; heed the deep
low voice of conscience; through the ill
and discord round about you, keep
your faith in human nature still

be gentle: unto griefs and needs
be pitiful as woman should
and, spite of all the lies of creeds
hold fast the truth that god is good

give and receive; go forth and bless
the world that needs the hand and heart
of martha's helpful carefulness
no less than mary's better part

so shall the stream of time flow by
and leave each year a richer good
and matron loveliness outvie
the nameless charm of maidenhood

and, when the world shall link your names
with gracious lives and manners fine
the teacher shall assert her claims
and proudly whisper, "these were mine



oh, that i might have my request, and that god would grant me the thing
that i long for.--_job 6:8

it was peeping through the brambles, that little wild white rose
where the hawthorn hedge was planted, my garden to enclose
all beyond was fern and heather, on the breezy, open moor
all within was sun and shelter, and the wealth of beauty's store
but i did not heed the fragrance of flow'ret or of tree
for my eyes were on that rosebud, and it grew too high for me
in vain i strove to reach it through the tangled mass of green
it only smiled and nodded behind its thorny screen
yet through that summer morning i lingered near the spot
oh, why do things seem sweeter if we possess them not
my garden buds were blooming, but all that i could see
was that little mocking wild rose, hanging just too high for me

so in life's wider garden there are buds of promise, too
beyond our reach to gather, but not beyond our view
and like the little charmer that tempted me astray
they steal out half the brightness of many a summer's day
oh, hearts that fail with longing for some forbidden tree
look up and learn a lesson from my white rose and me
than ever to be sighing for just one bud more sweet
my sunbeams and my shadows fall from a pierced hand
i can surely trust his wisdom since his heart i understand
and maybe in the morning, when his blessed face i see
he will tell me why my white rose grew just too high for me



when earth's last picture is painted, and the tubes are twisted and dried
when the oldest colors have faded, and the youngest critic has died
we shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it--lie down for an aeon or two
till the master of all good workmen shall set us to work anew

and those who were good shall be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair
they shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comet's hair
they shall find real saints to draw from--magdalene, peter and paul
they shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all

and only the master shall praise us, and only the master shall blame
and no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame
but each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star
shall draw the thing as he sees it for the god of things as they are



you're surprised that i ever should say so
just wait till the reason i've given
why i say i sha'n't care for the music
unless there is whistling in heaven
then you'll think it no very great wonder
nor so strange, nor so bold a conceit
that unless there's a boy there a-whistling
its music will not be complete

it was late in the autumn of '40
we had come from our far eastern home
just in season to build us a cabin
ere the cold of the winter should come
and we lived all the while in our wagon
that husband was clearing the place
where the house was to stand; and the clearing
and building it took many days

so that our heads were scarce sheltered
in under its roof when our store
of provisions was almost exhausted
and husband must journey for more
and the nearest place where he could get them
was yet such a distance away
that it forced him from home to be absent
at least a whole night and a day

you see, we'd but two or three neighbors
and the nearest was more than a mile
and we hadn't found time yet to know them
for we had been busy the while
and the man who had helped at the raising
just staid till the job was well done
and as soon as his money was paid him
had shouldered his axe and had gone

well, husband just kissed me and started
i could scarcely suppress a deep groan
at the thought of remaining with baby
so long in the house alone
for, my dear, i was childish and timid
and braver ones might well have feared
for the wild wolf was often heard howling
and savages sometimes appeared

but i smothered my grief and my terror
till husband was off on his ride
and then in my arms i took josey
and all the day long sat and cried
as i thought of the long, dreary hours
when the darkness of night should fall
and i was so utterly helpless
with no one in reach of my call

and when the night came with its terrors
to hide ev'ry ray of light
i hung up a quilt by the window
and, almost dead with affright
i kneeled by the side of the cradle
scarce daring to draw a full breath
lest the baby should wake, and its crying
should bring us a horrible death

there i knelt until late in the evening
and scarcely an inch had i stirred
when suddenly, far in the distance
a sound as of whistling i heard
i started up dreadfully frightened
for fear 'twas an indian's call
and then very soon i remembered
the red man ne'er whistles at all

and when i was sure 'twas a white man
i thought, were he coming for ill
he'd surely approach with more caution
would come without warning, and still
then the sound, coming nearer and nearer
took the form of a tune light and gay
and i knew i needn't fear evil
from one who could whistle that way

very soon i heard footsteps approaching
then came a peculiar dull thump
as if some one was heavily striking
an ax in the top of a stump
and then, in another brief moment
there came a light tap on the door
when quickly i undid the fast'ning
and in stepped a boy, and before

there was either a question or answer
or either had time to speak
i just threw my glad arms around him
and gave him a kiss on the cheek
then i started back, scared at my boldness
but he only smiled at my fright
as he said, "i'm your neighbor's boy, ellick
come to tarry with you through the night

and made up our minds where he'd gone
and i said to the rest of our people
and i venture she's awfully lonesome
and though she may have no great fear
i think she would feel a bit safer
if only a boy were but near

for fear that a savage might stray
across my path and need scalping
i started right down this way
and coming in sight of the cabin
and thinking to save you alarm
i whistled a tune, just to show you
i didn't intend any harm

but if you don't want me to stay
why, all you need do is to say so
and should'ring my axe, i'll away
i dropped in a chair and near fainted
just at thought of his leaving me then
and his eye gave a knowing bright twinkle
as he said, "i guess i'll remain

and then i just sat there and told him
how terribly frightened i'd been
how his face was to me the most welcome
of any i ever had seen
and then i lay down with the baby
and slept all the blessed night through
for i felt i was safe from all danger
near so brave a young fellow, and true

so now, my dear friend, do you wonder
since such a good reason i've given
why i say i sha'n't care for the music
unless there is whistling in heaven
yes, often i've said so in earnest
and now what i've said i repeat
that unless there's a boy there a-whistling
its music will not be complete


sleep, baby, sleep
thy father's watching the sheep
thy mother's shaking the dreamland tree
and down drops a little dream for thee
sleep, baby, sleep

sleep, baby, sleep
the large stars are the sheep
the little stars are the lambs, i guess
the bright moon is the shepherdess
sleep, baby, sleep

sleep, baby, sleep
thy savior loves his sheep
he is the lamb of god on high
who for our sakes came down to die
sleep, baby, sleep



seated one day at the organ
i was weary and ill at ease
and my fingers wandered idly
over the noisy keys

i do not know what i was playing
or what i was dreaming then
but i struck one chord of music
like the sound of a great amen

it flooded the crimson twilight
like the close of an angel's psalm
and it lay on my fevered spirit
with a touch of infinite calm

it quieted pain and sorrow
like love overcoming strife
it seemed the harmonious echo
from our discordant life

it linked all perplexing meanings
into one perfect peace
and trembled away into silence
as if it were loth to cease

i have sought, but i seek it vainly
that one lost chord divine
that came from the soul of the organ
and entered into mine

it may be that death's bright angel
will speak in that chord again
it may be that only in heaven
i shall hear that grand amen



between the dark and the daylight
when the night is beginning to lower
comes a pause in the day's occupations
that is known as the children's hour

i hear in the chamber above me
the patter of little feet
the sound of a door that is opened
and voices soft and sweet

from my study i see in the lamplight
descending the broad hall stair
grave alice, and laughing allegra
and edith with golden hair

a whisper, and then a silence
yet i know by their merry eyes
they are plotting and planning together
to take me by surprise

a sudden rush from the stairway
a sudden raid from the hall
by three doors left unguarded
they enter my castle wall

they climb up into my turret
o'er the arms and back of my chair
if i try to escape, they surround me
they seem to be everywhere

they almost devour me with kisses
their arms about me entwine
till i think of the bishop of bingen
in his mouse-tower on the rhine

do you think, o blue-eyed banditti
because you have scaled the wall
such an old mustache as i am
is not a match for you all

i have you fast in my fortress
and will not let you depart
but put you down into the dungeon
in the round-tower of my heart

and there will i keep you forever
yes, forever and a day
till the walls shall crumble to ruin
and moulder in dust away



woodman, spare that tree
touch not a single bough
in youth it sheltered me
and i'll protect it now
that placed it near his cot
there, woodman, let it stand
thy ax shall harm it not

that old familiar tree
whose glory and renown
are spread o'er land and sea
and wouldst thou hew it down
woodman, forbear thy stroke
cut not its earth-bound ties
oh, spare that aged oak
now towering to the skies

when but an idle boy
i sought its grateful shade
in all their gushing joy
here, too, my sisters played
my mother kissed me here
my father pressed my hand
forgive this foolish tear
but let that old oak stand

my heart-strings round thee cling
close as thy bark, old friend
here shall the wild-bird sing
and still thy branches bend
old tree! the storm still brave
and, woodman, leave the spot
while i've a hand to save
thy ax shall harm it not



they drive home the cows from the pasture
up through the long shady lane
where the quail whistles loud in the wheat-fields
that are yellow with ripening grain
they find, in the thick waving grasses
where the scarlet-lipped strawberry grows
they gather the earliest snowdrops
and the first crimson buds of the rose

they toss the new hay in the meadow
they gather the elder-bloom white
they find where the dusky grapes purple
in the soft-tinted october light
they know where the apples hang ripest
and are sweeter than italy's wines
they know where the fruit hangs the thickest
on the long, thorny blackberry vines

they gather the delicate sea-weeds
and build tiny castles of sand
they pick up the beautiful sea shells
fairy barks that have drifted to land
they wave from the tall, rocking tree-tops
where the oriole's hammock-nest swings
and at night time are folded in slumber
by a song that a fond mother sings

those who toil bravely are strongest
the humble and poor become great
and so from these brown-handed children
shall grow mighty rulers of state
the pen of the author and statesman
the noble and wise of the land
the sword, and the chisel, and palette
shall be held in the little brown hand



up from the meadows rich with corn
clear in the cool september morn

the clustered spires of frederick stand
green-walled by the hills of maryland

round about them orchards sweep
apple and peach tree fruited deep

fair as the garden of the lord
to the eyes of the famished rebel horde

on that pleasant morn of the early fall
when lee marched over the mountain-wall

over the mountains winding down
horse and foot, into frederick town

forty flags with their silver stars
forty flags with their crimson bars

flapped in the morning wind; the sun
of noon looked down, and saw not one

up rose old barbara frietchie then
bowed with her fourscore years and ten

bravest of all in frederick town
she took up the flag the men hauled down

in her attic window the staff she set
to show that one heart was loyal yet

up the street came the rebel tread
stonewall jackson riding ahead

under his slouched hat left and right
he glanced; the old flag met his sight


it shivered the window, pane and sash
it rent the banner with seam and gash

quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
dame barbara snatched the silken scarf

she leaned far out on the window-sill
and shook it forth with a royal will

but spare your country's flag," she said

a shade of sadness, a blush of shame
over the face of the leader came

the nobler nature within him stirred
to life at that woman's deed and word

dies like a dog; march on!" he said

all day long through frederick street
sounded the tread of marching feet

all day long that free flag tost
over the heads of the rebel host

ever its torn folds rose and fell
on the loyal winds that loved it well

and through the hill-gaps sunset light
shone over it a warm good night

barbara frietchie's work is o'er
and the rebel rides on his raids no more

honor to her! and let a tear
fall, for her sake, on stonewall's bier

over barbara frietchie's grave
flag of freedom and union wave

peace and order and beauty draw
round thy symbol of light and law

and ever the stars above look down
on thy stars below in frederick town



i started on a journey just about a week ago
for the little town of morrow, in the state of ohio
i never was a traveler, and really didn't know
that morrow had been ridiculed a century or so
i went down to the depot for my ticket and applied
for the tips regarding morrow, not expecting to be guyed
said i, "my friend, i want to go to morrow and return
not later than to-morrow, for i haven't time to burn

said he to me, "now let me see if i have heard you right
you want to go to morrow and come back to-morrow night
you should have gone to morrow yesterday and back to-day
for if you started yesterday to morrow, don't you see
you could have got to morrow and returned to-day at three
the train that started yesterday--now understand me right
to-day it gets to morrow, and returns to-morrow night

said i, "my boy, it seems to me you're talking through your hat
is there a town named morrow on your line? now tell me that
to go from here to morrow is a fourteen-hour trip
the train that goes to morrow leaves to-day eight-thirty-five
half after ten to-morrow is the time it should arrive
now if from here to morrow is a fourteen-hour jump
can you go to-day to morrow and come back to-day, you chump

said i, "i want to go to morrow; can i go to-day
and get to morrow by to-night, if there is no delay
can you go anywhere to-morrow and come back from there to-day
for if to-day you'd get to morrow, surely you'll agree
you should have started not to-day, but yesterday, you see
so if you start to morrow, leaving here to-day, you're flat
you won't get to morrow till the day that follows that

to-morrow into morrow, not to-day, you understand
for the train to-day to morrow, if the schedule is right
will get you into morrow by about to-morrow night
said i, "i guess you know it all, but kindly let me say
how can i go to morrow, if i leave the town to-day
said he, "you cannot go to morrow any more to-day
for the train that goes to morrow is a mile upon its way


i was so disappointed i was mad enough to swear
the train had gone to morrow and had left me standing there
the man was right in telling me i was a howling jay
i didn't go to morrow, so i guess i'll go to-day


the little cares that fretted me
i lost them yesterday
among the fields above the seas
among the winds at play
among the lowing of the herds
the rustling of the trees
among the singing of the birds
the humming of the bees

the foolish fears of what might happen
i cast them all away
among the clover-scented grass
among the new-mown hay
among the husking of the corn
where drowsy poppies nod
where ill thoughts die and good are born
out in the fields with god



i know the song that the bluebird is singing
out in the apple tree where he is swinging
brave little fellow! the skies may be dreary
nothing cares he while his heart is so cheery

hark! how the music leaps out from his throat
hark! was there ever so merry a note
listen a while, and you'll hear what he's saying
up in the apple tree swinging and swaying

you must be weary of winter i know
listen, i'll sing you a message of cheer
summer is coming! and springtime is here

bright yellow crocus! please open your eyes
sweet little violets, hid from the cold
put on your mantles of purple and gold
daffodils! daffodils! say, do you hear
summer is coming, and springtime is here



old ironsides at anchor lay
in the harbor of mahon
a dead calm rested on the bay
the waves to sleep had gone
when little hal, the captain's son
a lad both brave and good
in sport, up shroud and rigging ran
and on the main truck stood

a shudder shot through every vein
all eyes were turned on high
there stood the boy, with dizzy brain
between the sea and sky
no hold had he above, below
alone he stood in air
to that far height none dared to go
no aid could reach him there

we gazed, but not a man could speak
with horror all aghast
in groups, with pallid brow and cheek
we watched the quivering mast
the atmosphere grew thick and hot
and of a lurid hue
as riveted unto the spot
stood officers and crew

the father came on deck:--he gasped
then suddenly a rifle grasped
and aimed it at his son
jump, or i fire," he said
jump, jump, boy!" he obeyed

he sunk,--he rose,--he lived,--he moved
and for the ship struck out
on board we hailed the lad beloved
with many a manly shout
his father drew, in silent joy
those wet arms round his neck
and folded to his heart his boy
then fainted on the deck



i shot an arrow into the air
it fell to earth, i knew not where
for, so swiftly it flew, the sight
could not follow it in its flight

i breathed a song into the air
it fell to earth, i knew not where
for who has sight so keen and strong
that it can follow the flight of song

long, long afterward, in an oak
i found the arrow, still unbroke
and the song, from beginning to end
i found again in the heart of a friend



the justice, laughing, said, "oh no
i only meant the loads of snow
upon the roofs. the barn is weak
i greatly fear the roof will break
so hand me up the spade, my dear
i'll mount the barn, the roof to clear
and if you slip, and fall, and die
how will my living be secured
stephen, your life is not insured
but tie a rope your waist around
and it will hold you safe and sound
all snugly tied, and danger-proof
excelsior! excel--but no
the rope is not secured below
said rachel, "climb, the end to throw
across the top, and i will go
and tie that end around my waist
you always would be tightly laced
rachel, when you became my bride
i thought the knot securely tied
but lest the bond should break in twain
i'll have it fastened once again
below the arm-pits tied around
she takes her station on the ground
while on the roof, beyond the ridge
he shovels clear the lower edge
but, sad mischance! the loosened snow
comes sliding down, to plunge below
and as he tumbles with the slide
up rachel goes on t'other side
just half-way down the justice hung
just half-way up the woman swung

the couple, dangling in the breeze
like turkeys hung outside to freeze
at their rope's end and wits' end, too
shout back and forth what best to do
cried stephen, "take it coolly, wife
all have their ups and downs in life
quoth rachel, "what a pity 'tis
to joke at such a thing as this
a man whose wife is being hung
should know enough to hold his tongue
i see a tempting heap of snow
suppose, my dear, i take my knife
and cut the rope to save my life
she shouted, "don't! 'twould be my death
i see some pointed stones beneath
a better way would be to call
with all our might, for phebe hall
gave tongue; "o phebe! phebe! _phe-e-be_ hall!" in tones both fine
and coarse
enough to make a drover hoarse

now phebe, over at the farm
was sitting, sewing, snug and warm
but hearing, as she thought, her name
sprang up, and to the rescue came
beheld the scene, and thus she thought
and i could reach the lady's foot
i'd draw her downward by the boot
then cut the rope, and let him go
he cannot miss the pile of snow
he sees her moving toward his wife
armed with a chair and carving-knife
and, ere he is aware, perceives
his head ascending to the eaves
and, guessing what the two are at
screams from beneath the roof, "stop that
you make me fall too far, by half
but phebe answers, with a laugh
you've brought your wife to such a plight
and then, with well-directed blows
she cuts the rope and down he goes
the wife untied, they walk around
when lo! no stephen can be found
they call in vain, run to and fro
they look around, above, below
no trace or token can they see
and deeper grows the mystery
then rachel's heart within her sank
but, glancing at the snowy bank
she caught a little gleam of hope
a gentle movement of the rope
they scrape away a little snow
what's this? a hat! ah! he's below
then upward heaves the snowy pile
and forth he stalks in tragic style
unhurt, and with a roguish smile
and rachel sees, with glad surprise
the missing found, the fallen rise



about the time of christmas
when the sky was black
with wrath and rack
and the earth was white with snow
when loudly rang the tumult
of winds and waves of strife
in her home by the sea
with her babe on her knee
sat harry conquest's wife

and he was on the ocean
although she knew not where
for never a lip
could tell of the ship
to lighten her heart's despair
and her babe was fading and dying
the pulse in the tiny wrist
was all but still
and the brow was chill
and pale as the white sea mist

jane conquest's heart was hopeless
she could only weep and pray
that the shepherd mild
would take her child
without a pain away
the night was dark and darker
and the storm grew stronger still
and buried in deep
and dreamless sleep
lay the hamlet under the hill

the fire was dead on the hearthstone
within jane conquest's room
and still sat she
with her babe on her knee
at prayer amid the gloom
when, borne above the tempest
a sound fell on her ear
thrilling her through
for well she knew

and a light leaped in at the lattice
sudden and swift and red
crimsoning all
the whited wall
and the floor, and the roof o'erhead
for one brief moment, heedless
of the babe upon her knee
with the frenzied start
of a frightened heart
upon her feet rose she

and through the quaint old casement
she looks upon the sea
thank god that the sight
she saw that night
so rare a sight should be
hemmed in by many a billow
with mad and foaming lip
a mile from shore
or hardly more
she saw a gallant ship

and to her horror she beheld it
aflame from stem to stern
for there seemed no speck
on all that wreck
where the fierce fire did not burn
till the night was like a sunset
and the sea like a sea of blood
and the rocks and shore
were bathed all o'er
and drenched with the gory flood

she looked and looked, till the terror
went creeping through every limb
and her breath came quick
and her heart grew sick
and her sight grew dizzy and dim
and her lips had lost their utterance
for she tried but could not speak
and her feelings found
no channel of sound
in prayer, or sob, or shriek

once more that cry of anguish
thrilled through the tempest's strife
and it stirred again
in heart and brain
the active thinking life
and the light of an inspiration
leaped to her brightened eye
and on lip and brow
was written now
a purpose pure and high

swiftly she turns, and softly
she crosses the chamber floor
and faltering not
in his tiny cot
she laid the babe she bore
and then with a holy impulse
she sank to her knees, and made
a lowly prayer
in the silence there
and this was the prayer she prayed

and who now dost wear the crown
i at thy feet
o true and sweet
would lay my burden down
thou bad'st me love and cherish
the babe thou gavest me
and i have kept
thy word, nor stept
aside from following thee

and vain is all my care
and my burden's weight
is very great
yea, greater than i can bear
o lord, thou know'st what peril
doth threat these poor men's lives
and i, a woman
most weak and human
do plead for their waiting wives

up, lord, in thy strength, and save
from the scorching breath
of this terrible death
on this cruel winter wave
take thou my babe and watch it
no care is like to thine
and let thy power
in this perilous hour
supply what lack is mine

and so her prayer she ended
and rising to her feet
gave one long look
at the cradle nook
where the child's faint pulses beat
and then with softest footsteps
retrod the chamber floor
and noiselessly groped
for the latch, and oped
and crossed the cottage door

and through the tempest bravely
jane conquest fought her way
by snowy deep
and slippery steep
to where her duty lay
and she journeyed onward, breathless
and weary and sore and faint
yet forward pressed
with the strength, and the zest
and the ardor of a saint

solemn, and weird, and lonely
amid its countless graves
stood the old gray church
on its tall rock perch
secure from the sea and its waves
and beneath its sacred shadow
lay the hamlet safe and still
for however the sea
and the wind might be
there was quiet under the hill

jane conquest reached the churchyard
and stood by the old church door
but the oak was tough
and had bolts enough
and her strength was frail and poor
so she crept through a narrow window
and climbed the belfry stair
and grasped the rope
sole cord of hope
for the mariners in despair

and the wild wind helped her bravely
and she wrought with an earnest will
and the clamorous bell
spoke out right well
to the hamlet under the hill
and it roused the slumbering fishers
nor its warning task gave o'er
till a hundred fleet
and eager feet
were hurrying to the shore

and then it ceased its ringing
for the woman's work was done
and many a boat
that was now afloat
showed man's work had begun
but the ringer in the belfry
lay motionless and cold
with the cord of hope
the church-bell rope
still in her frozen hold

how long she lay it boots not
but she woke from her swoon at last
in her own bright room
to find the gloom
and the grief, and the peril past
with the sense of joy within her
and the christ's sweet presence near
and friends around
and the cooing sound
of her babe's voice in her ear

and they told her all the story
how a brave and gallant few
o'ercame each check
and reached the wreck
and saved the hopeless crew
and how the curious sexton
had climbed the belfry stair
and of his fright
when, cold and white
he found her lying there

and how, when they had borne her
back to her home again
the child she left
with a heart bereft
of hope, and weary with pain
was found within his cradle
in a quiet slumber laid
with a peaceful smile
on his lips the while
and the wasting sickness stayed

and she said "twas the christ who watched it
and brought it safely through
and she praised his truth
and his tender ruth
who had saved her darling too


to drum beat and heart beat
a soldier marches by
there is color in his cheek
there is courage in his eye
yet to drum beat and heart beat
in a moment he must die

by starlight and moonlight
he seeks the britons' camp
he hears the rustling flag
and the armed sentry's tramp
and the starlight and moonlight
his silent wanderings lamp

with a slow tread and still tread
he scans the tented line
and he counts the battery guns
by the gaunt and shadowy pine
and his slow tread and still tread
gives no warning sign

the dark wave, the plumed wave
it meets his eager glance
and it sparkles 'neath the stars
like the glimmer of a lance
a dark wave, a plumed wave
on an emerald expanse

a sharp clang, a steel clang
and terror in the sound
for the sentry, falcon-eyed
in the camp a spy has found
with a sharp clang, a steel clang
the patriot is bound

with calm brow, steady brow
he listens to his doom
in his look there is no fear
nor a shadow trace of gloom
but with calm brow, steady brow
he robes him for the tomb

in the long night, the still night
he kneels upon the sod
and the brutal guards withhold
e'en the solemn word of god
in the long night, the still night
he walks where christ hath trod

he dies upon the tree
and he mourns that he can give
but one life for liberty
and in the blue morn, the sunny morn
his spent wings are free

but his last words, his message words
they burn, lest friendly eye
should read how proud and calm
a patriot could die
with his last words, his dying words
a soldier's battle cry

from fame-leaf and angel-leaf
from monument and urn
the sad of earth, the glad of heaven
his tragic fate shall learn
and on fame-leaf and angel-leaf
the name of hale shall burn



you are coming to woo me, but not as of yore
when i hastened to welcome your ring at the door
for i trusted that he who stood waiting me then
was the brightest, the truest, the noblest of men
your lips on my own when they printed "farewell
had never been soiled by "the beverage of hell
but they come to me now with the bacchanal sign
and the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine

i think of that night in the garden alone
when in whispers you told me your heart was my own
that your love in the future should faithfully be
unshared by another, kept only for me
oh, sweet to my soul is the memory still
of the lips which met mine, when they murmured "i will
but now to their pressure no more they incline
for the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine

o john! how it crushed me, when first in your face
the pen of the "rum fiend" had written "disgrace
and turned me in silence and tears from that breath
all poisoned and foul from the chalice of death
it scattered the hopes i had treasured to last
it darkened the future and clouded the past
it shattered my idol, and ruined the shrine
for the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine

i loved you--oh, dearer than language can tell
and you saw it, you proved it, you knew it too well
but the man of my love was far other than he
who now from the "tap-room" comes reeling to me
in manhood and honor so noble and right
his heart was so true, and his genius so bright
and his soul was unstained, unpolluted by wine
but the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine

you promised reform, but i trusted in vain
your pledge was but made to be broken again
and the lover so false to his promises now
will not, as a husband, be true to his vow
the word must be spoken that bids you depart
though the effort to speak it should shatter my heart
though in silence, with blighted affection, i pine
yet the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine

if one spark in your bosom of virtue remain
go fan it with prayer till it kindle again
resolved, with "god helping," in future to be
from wine and its follies unshackled and free
and when you have conquered this foe of your soul
in manhood and honor beyond his control
this heart will again beat responsive to thine
and the lips free from liquor be welcome to mine



when you come to the end of a perfect day
and you sit alone with your thought
while the chimes ring out with a carol gay
for the joy that the day has brought
do you think what the end of a perfect day
can mean to a tired heart
when the sun goes down with a flaming ray
and the dear friends have to part

well, this is the end of a perfect day
near the end of a journey, too
but it leaves a thought that is big and strong
with a wish that is kind and true
for mem'ry has painted this perfect day
with colors that never fade
and we find, at the end of a perfect day
the soul of a friend we've made



kate ketchem on a winter's night
went to a party dressed in white
her chignon in a net of gold
was about as large as they ever sold
gayly she went, because her "pap
was supposed to be a rich old chap

but when by chance her glances fell
on a friend who had lately married well
her spirits sunk, and a vague unrest
and a nameless longing filled her breast
a wish she wouldn't have had made known
to have an establishment of her own

tom fudge came slowly through the throng
with chestnut hair, worn pretty long
he saw kate ketchem in the crowd
and knowing her slightly, stopped and bowed
then asked her to give him a single flower
saying he'd think it a priceless dower

out from those with which she was decked
she took the poorest she could select
and blushed as she gave it, looking down
to call attention to her gown
flowers must be at that time of year

then several charming remarks he made
asked if she sang, or danced, or played
and being exhausted, inquired whether
she thought it was going to be pleasant weather
and kate displayed her "jewelry
and dropped her lashes becomingly
and listened, with no attempt to disguise
the admiration in her eyes
at last, like one who has nothing to say
he turned around and walked away

kate ketchem smiled, and said, "you bet
i'll catch that fudge and his money yet
he's rich enough to keep me in clothes
and i think i could manage him as i chose
he could aid my father as well as not
and buy my brother a splendid yacht
my mother for money should never fret
and all it cried for the baby should get
and after that, with what he could spare
i'd make a show at a charity fair

tom fudge looked back as he crossed the sill
and saw kate ketchem standing still
it isn't an easy thing to find
and every thing that she has to wear
proves her as rich as she is fair
would she were mine, and i to-day
had the old man's cash my debts to pay
no creditors with a long account
no tradesmen wanting 'that little amount
but all my scores paid up when due
by a father-in-law as rich as a jew

but he thought of her brother, not worth a straw
and her mother, that would be his, in law
so, undecided, he walked along
and kate was left alone in the throng
but a lawyer smiled, whom he sought by stealth
to ascertain old ketchem's wealth
and as for kate, she schemed and planned
till one of the dancers claimed her hand

he married her for her father's cash
she married him to cut a dash
but as to paying his debts, do you know
the father couldn't see it so
and at hints for help, kate's hazel eyes
looked out in their innocent surprise
and when tom thought of the way he had wed
he longed for a single life instead
and closed his eyes in a sulky mood
regretting the days of his bachelorhood
and said, in a sort of reckless vein
if i were free, as on that night
when i saw kate ketchem dressed in white

she wedded him to be rich and gay
but husband and children didn't pay
he wasn't the prize she hoped to draw
and wouldn't live with his mother-in-law
and oft when she had to coax and pout
in order to get him to take her out
she thought how very attentive and bright
he seemed at the party that winter's night
of his laugh, as soft as a breeze of the south
how he praised her dress and gems in his talk
as he took a careful account of stock

sometimes she hated the very walls
hated her friends, her dinners, and calls
till her weak affection, to hatred turned
like a dying tallow-candle burned
and for him who sat there, her peace to mar
smoking his everlasting cigar
he wasn't the man she thought she saw
and grief was duty, and hate was law
so she took up her burden with a groan
saying only, "i might have known

alas for kate! and alas for fudge
though i do not owe them any grudge
and alas for any who find to their shame
that two can play at their little game
for of all hard things to bear and grin
the hardest is knowing you're taken in
ah, well! as a general thing, we fret
about the one we didn't get
but i think we needn't make a fuss
if the one we don't want didn't get us



by the old moulmein pagoda, lookin' eastward to the sea
there's a burma girl a-settin', an' i know she thinks o' me
for the wind is in the palm-trees, an' the temple-bells they say
come you back to mandalay
where the old flotilla lay
can't you 'ear their paddles chunkin' from rangoon to mandalay
on the road to mandalay
where the flyin'-fishes play
an' the dawn comes up like thunder outer china 'crost the bay

an' 'er name was supi-yaw-lat--jes' the same as theebaw's queen
an' i seed her fust a-smokin' of a whackin' white cheroot
an' a-wastin' christian kisses on an 'eathen idol's foot
bloomin' idol made o' mud
wot they called the great gawd budd
plucky lot she cared for idols when i kissed 'er where she stud
on the road to mandalay

when the mist was on the rice-fields an' the sun was droppin' low
she'd git 'er little banjo an' she'd sing "_kul-la-lo-lo
with 'er arm upon my shoulder an' her cheek agin my cheek
we useter watch the steamers and the _hathis_ pilin' teak
elephints a-pilin' teak
in the sludgy, squdgy creek
where the silence 'ung that 'eavy you was arf afraid to speak
on the road to mandalay

but that's all shove be'ind me--long ago an' fur away
an' there ain't no 'buses runnin' from the benk to mandalay
an' i'm learnin' 'ere in london what the ten-year sodger tells
no! you won't 'eed nothin' else
but them spicy garlic smells
an' the sunshine an' the palm-trees an' the tinkly temple-bells
on the road to mandalay

i am sick o' wastin' leather on these gutty pavin'-stones
an' the blasted henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones
tho' i walks with fifty 'ousemaids outer chelsea to the strand
an' they talk a lot o' lovin', but wot do they understand
beefy face an' grubby 'and
law! wot _do_ they understand
i've a neater, sweeter maiden in a cleaner, greener land
on the road to mandalay

ship me somewheres east of suez where the best is like the worst
where there aren't no ten commandments, an' a man can raise a thirst
for the temple-bells are callin', an' it's there that i would be
by the old moulmein pagoda, lookin' lazy at the sea
on the road to mandalay
where the old flotilla lay
with our sick beneath the awnings when we went to mandalay
on the road to mandalay
where the flyin'-fishes play
an' the dawn comes up like thunder outer china 'crost the bay



behind him lay the gray azores
behind the gates of hercules
before him not the ghost of shores
before him only shoreless seas
the good mate said: "now must we pray
for lo! the very stars are gone
brave adm'r'l, speak; what shall i say

my men grow ghastly wan and weak
the stout mate thought of home; a spray
of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek
if we sight naught but seas at dawn

they sailed and sailed, as winds might blow
until at last the blanched mate said
should i and all my men fall dead
these very winds forget their way
for god from these dread seas is gone
now speak, brave adm'r'l, speak and say
he said: "sail on! sail on! and on

they sailed. they sailed. then spake the mate
he curls his lips, he lies in wait
with lifted teeth, as if to bite
brave adm'r'l, say but one good word
what shall we do when hope is gone
the words leapt like a leaping sword

then, pale and worn, he kept his deck
and peered through darkness. ah, that night
of all dark nights! and then a speck
a light! a light! a light! a light
it grew, a starlit flag unfurled
it grew to be time's burst of dawn
he gained a world; he gave that world
its grandest lesson; "on! sail on



my sister's best feller is 'most six-foot-three
and handsome and strong as a feller can be
and sis, she's so little, and slender, and small
you never would think she could boss him at all
but, my jing
she don't do a thing
but make him jump 'round, like he worked with a string
it jest made me 'shamed of him sometimes, you know
to think that he'll let a girl bully him so

he goes to walk with her and carries her muff
and coat and umbrella, and that kind of stuff
she loads him with things that must weigh 'most a ton
and, honest, he _likes_ it,--as if it was fun
and, oh, say
when they go to a play
he'll sit in the parlor and fidget away
and she won't come down till it's quarter past eight
and then she'll scold _him_ 'cause they get there so late

he spends heaps of money a-buyin' her things
like candy, and flowers, and presents, and rings
and all he's got for 'em's a handkerchief case
a fussed-up concern, made of ribbons and lace
but, my land! he thinks it's just grand
he calls her "an angel"--i heard him--and "saint
and "beautif'lest bein' on earth"--but she ain't

i just make her coax me, and give me a dime
but that great big silly--why, honest and true
he'd run forty miles if she wanted him to
oh, gee whiz
i tell you what 'tis
i jest think it's _awful_--those actions of his
i won't fall in love, when i'm grown--no sir-ee
my sister's best feller's a warnin' to me



out where the handclasp's a little stronger
out where a smile dwells a little longer
that's where the west begins
out where the sun's a little brighter
where the snow that falls is a trifle whiter
where the bonds of home are a wee bit tighter
that's where the west begins

out where the skies are a trifle bluer
out where friendship's a little truer
that's where the west begins
out where a fresher breeze is blowing
where there is laughter in every streamlet flowing
where there's more of reaping and less of sowing
that's where the west begins

out where the world is in the making
where fewer hearts with despair are aching
that's where the west begins
where there is more of singing and less of sighing
where there is more of giving and less of buying
and a man makes friends without half trying
that's where the west begins



let us take to our hearts a lesson--no lesson can braver be
from the ways of the tapestry weavers on the other side of the sea
above their heads the pattern hangs, they study it with care
the while their fingers deftly move, their eyes are fastened there

they tell this curious thing, besides, of the patient, plodding weaver
he works on the wrong side evermore, but works for the right side ever
it is only when the weaving stops, and the web is loosed and turned
that he sees his real handiwork--that his marvelous skill is learned

ah, the sight of its delicate beauty, how it pays him for all his cost
no rarer, daintier work than his was ever done by the frost
then the master bringeth him golden hire, and giveth him praise as well
and how happy the heart of the weaver is, no tongue but his can tell

the years of man are the looms of god, let down from the place of the sun
wherein we are weaving ever, till the mystic web is done
weaving blindly but weaving surely each for himself his fate
we may not see how the right side looks, we can only weave and wait

but, looking above for the pattern, no weaver hath to fear
only let him look clear into heaven, the perfect pattern is there
if he keeps the face of the savior forever and always in sight
his toil shall be sweeter than honey, his weaving sure to be right

and when the work is ended, and the web is turned and shown
he shall hear the voice of the master, it shall say unto him, "well done
and the white-winged angels of heaven, to bear him shall come down
and god shall give him gold for his hire--not a coin--but a glowing crown


when the teacher gets cross, and her blue eyes gets black
and the pencil comes down on the desk with a whack
we chillen all sit up straight in a line
as if we had rulers instead of a spine
and it's scary to cough, and it a'n't safe to grin
when the teacher gets cross, and the dimples goes in

when the teacher gets cross, the tables get mixed
the ones and the twos begins to play tricks
the pluses and minuses is just little smears
when the cry babies cry their slates full of tears
and the figgers won't add,--but just act up like sin
when the teacher gets cross, and the dimples goes in

when the teacher gets cross, the reading gets bad
the lines jingle round till the' chillen is sad
and billy boy puffs and gets red in the face
as if he and the lesson were running a race
until she hollers out, "next!" as sharp as a pin
when the teacher gets cross, and the dimples goes in

when the teacher gets good, her smile is so bright
that the tables gets straight, and the reading gets right
the pluses and minuses comes trooping along
and the figgers add up and stop being wrong
and we chillen would like, but we dassent, to shout
when the teacher gets good, and the dimples comes out


god of our fathers, known of old
lord of our far-flung battle line
beneath whose awful hand we hold
dominion over palm and pine
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget

the tumult and the shouting dies
the captains and the kings depart
still stands thine ancient sacrifice
an humble and a contrite heart
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget

far-called, our navies melt away
on dune and headland sinks the fire
lo, all our pomp of yesterday
is one with nineveh and tyre
judge of the nations, spare us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget

if, drunk with sight of power, we loose
wild tongues that have not thee in awe
such boasting as the gentiles use
or lesser breeds without the law
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget

for heathen heart that puts her trust
in reeking tube and iron shard
all valiant dust that builds on dust
and guarding, calls not thee to guard
for frantic boast and foolish word
thy mercy on thy people, lord




o friends! with whom my feet have trod
the quiet aisles of prayer
glad witness to your zeal for god
and love of man i bear

i trace your lines of argument
your logic linked and strong
i weigh as one who dreads dissent
and fears a doubt as wrong

but still my human hands are weak
to hold your iron creeds
against the words ye bid me speak
my heart within me pleads

who fathoms the eternal thought
who talks of scheme and plan
the lord is god! he needeth not
the poor device of man

i walk with bare, hushed feet the ground
ye tread with boldness shod
i dare not fix with mete and bound
the love and power of god

ye praise his justice; even such
his pitying love i deem
ye seek a king; i fain would touch
the robe that hath no seam

ye see the curse which overbroods
a world of pain and loss
i hear our lord's beatitudes
and prayer upon the cross

more than your schoolmen teach, within
myself, alas! i know
too dark ye cannot paint the sin
too small the merit show

i bow my forehead to the dust
i veil mine eyes for shame
and urge, in trembling self-distrust
a prayer without a claim

i see the wrong that round me lies
i feel the guilt within
i hear, with groan and travail-cries
the world confess its sin

yet, in the maddening maze of things
and tossed by storm and flood
to one fixed stake my spirit clings
i know that god is good

not mine to look where cherubim
and seraphs may not see
but nothing can be good in him
which evil is in me

the wrong that pains my soul below
i dare not throne above
i know not of his hate,--i know
his goodness and his love

i dimly guess from blessings known
of greater out of sight
and, with the chastened psalmist, own
his judgments too are right

i long for household voices gone
for vanished smiles i long
but god hath led my dear ones on
and he can do no wrong

i know not what the future hath
of marvel or surprise
assured alone that life and death
his mercy underlies

and if my heart and flesh are weak
to bear an untried pain
the bruised reed he will not break
but strengthen and sustain

no offering of my own i have
nor works my faith to prove
i can but give the gifts he gave
and plead his love for love

and so beside the silent sea
i wait the muffled oar
no harm from him can come to me
on ocean or on shore

i know not where his islands lift
their fronded palms in air
i only know i cannot drift
beyond his love and care

o brothers! if my faith is vain
if hopes like these betray
pray for me that my feet may gain
the sure and safer way

and thou, o lord! by whom are seen
thy creatures as they be
forgive me if too close i lean
my human heart on thee



out of the clover and blue-eyed grass
he turned them into the river-lane
one after another he let them pass
then fastened the meadow-bars again

under the willows and over the hill
he patiently followed their sober pace
the merry whistle for once was still
and something shadowed the sunny face

only a boy! and his father had said
he never could let his youngest go
two already were lying dead
under the feet of the trampling foe

but after the evening work was done
and the frogs were loud in the meadow swamp
over his shoulder he slung his gun
and stealthily followed the footpath damp

across the clover and through the wheat
with resolute heart and purpose grim
though cold was the dew on his hurrying feet
and the blind bat's flitting startled him

thrice since then had the lanes been white
and the orchards sweet with apple bloom
and now, when the cows came back at night
the feeble father drove them home

for news had come to the lonely farm
that three were lying where two had lain
and the old man's tremulous, palsied arm
could never lean on a son's again

the summer day grew cool and late
he went for the cows when the work was done
but down the lane, as he opened the gate
he saw them coming, one by one

brindle, ebony, speckle, and bess
shaking their horns in the evening wind
cropping the buttercups out of the grass
but who was it following close behind

loosely swung in the idle air
the empty sleeve of army blue
and worn and pale, from the crisping hair
looked out a face that the father knew

for southern prisons will sometimes yawn
and yield their dead unto life again
and the day that comes with a cloudy dawn
in golden glory at last may wane

the great tears sprang to their meeting eyes
for the heart must speak when the lips are dumb
and under the silent evening skies
together they followed the cattle home



your flag and my flag
and, oh, how much it holds
your land and my land
secure within its folds
your heart and my heart
beat quicker at the sight
sun-kissed and wind-tossed
red and blue and white
the one flag--the great flag--the flag for me and you
glorified all else beside--the red and white and blue

your flag and my flag
to every star and stripe
the drums beat as hearts beat
and fifers shrilly pipe
your flag and my flag
a blessing in the sky
your hope and my hope
it never hid a lie
home land and far land and half the world around
old glory hears our glad salute and ripples to the sound



oh! they've swept the parlor carpet, and they've dusted every chair
and they've got the tidies hangin' jest exactly on the square
and the what-not's fixed up lovely, and the mats have all been beat
and the pantry's brimmin' over with the bully things ter eat
sis has got her sunday dress on, and she's frizzin' up her bangs
ma's got on her best alpacky, and she's askin' how it hangs
and it's all because we're goin' ter have the minister ter tea
oh! the table's fixed up gaudy, with the gilt-edged chiny set
and we'll use the silver tea-pot and the comp'ny spoons, you bet
and we're goin' ter have some fruitcake and some thimbleberry jam
and "riz biscuits," and some doughnuts, and some chicken, and some ham
ma, she'll 'polergize like fury and say everything is bad
and "sich awful luck with cookin'," she is sure she never had
but, er course, she's only bluffin,' for it's as prime as it can be
and she's only talkin' that way 'cause the minister's ter tea
everybody'll be a-smilin' and as good as ever was
pa  won't growl about the vittles, like he generally does
and he'll ask me would i like another piece er pie; but, sho
that, er course, is only manners, and i'm s'posed ter answer "no
sis'll talk about the church-work and about the sunday-school
ma'll tell how she liked that sermon that was on the golden rule
and if i upset my tumbler they won't say a word ter me
yes, a boy can eat in comfort with the minister ter tea
say! a minister, you'd reckon, never'd say what wasn't true
but that isn't so with ours, and i jest can prove it, too
why, he sets and says it's lovely; and that, seems ter me,'s a lie
but i like him all the samey, and i only wish he'd stay
at our house fer good and always, and eat with us every day
only think of havin' goodies _every_ evenin'! jimmin_ee
and i'd _never_ git a scoldin' with the minister ter tea



when klingle, klangle, klingle
far down the dusty dingle
the cows are coming home

now sweet and clear, now faint and low
the airy tinklings come and go
like chimings from the far-off tower
or patterings of an april shower
that makes the daisies grow
ko-ling, ko-lang, kolinglelingle
far down the darkening dingle
the cows come slowly home

and old-time friends, and twilight plays
and starry nights and sunny days
come trooping up the misty ways
when the cows come home
with jingle, jangle, jingle
soft tones that sweetly mingle
the cows are coming home

malvine, and pearl, and florimel
dekamp, red rose, and gretchen schell
queen bess and sylph, and spangled sue
across the fields i hear her "loo-oo
and clang her silver bell
go-ling, go-lang, golingledingle
with faint, far sounds that mingle
the cows come slowly home

and mother-songs of long-gone years
and baby-joys and childish fears
and youthful hopes and youthful tears
when the cows come home
with ringle, rangle, ringle
by twos and threes and single
the cows are coming home

through violet air we see the town
and the summer sun a-sliding down
and the maple in the hazel glade
throws down the path a longer shade
and the hills are growing brown
to-ring, to-rang, toringleringle
by threes and fours and single
the cows come slowly home

the same sweet sound of wordless psalm
the same sweet june-day rest and calm
the same sweet smell of buds and balm
when the cows come home
with tinkle, tankle, tinkle
through fern and periwinkle
the cows are coming home

a-loitering in the checkered stream
where the sun-rays glance and gleam
clarine, peach-bloom and phebe phillis
stand knee-deep in the creamy lilies
in a drowsy dream
to-link, to-lank, tolinklelinkle
o'er banks with buttercups a-twinkle
the cows come slowly home

and up through memory's deep ravine
come the brook's old song and its old-time sheen
and the crescent of the silver queen
when the cows come home
with klingle, klangle, klingle
with loo-oo, and moo-oo and jingle
the cows are coming home

and over there on merlin hill
sounds the plaintive cry of the whip-poor-will
and the dew-drops lie on the tangled vines
and over the poplars venus shines
and over the silent mill
ko-ling, ko-lang, kolinglelingle
with ting-a-ling and jingle
the cows come slowly home

let down the bars; let in the train
of long-gone songs, and flowers, and rain
for dear old times come back again
when the cows come home



dead! is it possible? he, the bold rider
custer, our hero, the first in the fight
charming the bullets of yore to fly wider
shunning our battle-king's ringlets of light
dead! our young chieftain, and dead all forsaken
no one to tell us the way of his fall
slain in the desert, and never to waken
never, not even to victory's call

comrades, he's gone! but ye need not be grieving
no, may my death be like his when i die
no regrets wasted on words i am leaving
falling with brave men, and face to the sky
death's but a journey, the greatest must take it
fame is eternal, and better than all
gold though the bowl be, 'tis fate that must break it
glory can hallow the fragments that fall

proud for his fame that last day that he met them
all the night long he had been on their track
scorning their traps and the men that had set them
wild for a charge that should never give back
there, on the hilltop he halted and saw them
lodges all loosened and ready to fly
hurrying scouts with the tidings to awe them
told of his coming before he was nigh

all the wide valley was full of their forces
gathered to cover the lodges' retreat
warriors running in haste to their horses
thousands of enemies close to his feet
down in the valleys the ages had hollowed
there lay the sitting bull's camp for a prey
numbers! what recked he? what recked those who followed
men who had fought ten to one ere that day

out swept the squadrons, the fated three hundred
into the battle-line steady and full
then down the hillside exultingly thundered
into the hordes of the old sitting bull
wild ogalallah, arapahoe, cheyenne
wild horse's braves, and the rest of their crew
shrank from that charge like a herd from a lion
then closed around the great hell of wild sioux

right to their center he charged, and then, facing
hark to those yells and around them, oh, see
over the hilltops the devils come racing
coming as fast as the waves of the sea
red was the circle of fire about them
no hope of victory, no ray of light
shot through that terrible black cloud about them
brooding in death over custer's last fight

then did he blench? did he die like a craven
begging those torturing fiends for his life
was there a soldier who carried the seven
flinched like a coward or fled from the strife
no, by the blood of our custer, no quailing
there in the midst of the devils they close
hemmed in by thousands, but ever assailing
fighting like tigers, all bayed amid foes

thicker and thicker the bullets came singing
down go the horses and riders and all
swiftly the warriors round them were ringing
circling like buzzards awaiting their fall
see the wild steeds of the mountain and prairie
savage eyes gleaming from forests of mane
quivering lances with pennons so airy
war-painted warriors charging amain

backward again and again they were driven
shrinking to close with the lost little band
never a cap that had worn the bright seven
bowed till its wearer was dead on the strand
closer and closer the death-circle growing
even the leader's voice, clarion clear
rang out his words of encouragement glowing

dearly they sold them, like berserkers raging
facing the death that encircled them round
death's bitter pangs by their vengeance assuaging
marking their tracks by their dead on the ground
comrades, our children shall yet tell their story
custer's last charge on the old sitting bull
and ages shall swear that the cup of his glory
needed but that death to render it full



what's the matter, stummick? ain't i always been your friend
ain't i always been a pardner to you? all my pennies don't i spend
in getting nice things for you? don't i give you lots of cake
say, stummick, what's the matter, you had to go an' ache

why, i loaded you with good things yesterday
i gave you more corn an' chicken than you'd ever had before
i gave you fruit an' candy, apple pie an' chocolate cake
an' last night when i got to bed you had to go an' ache

say, what's the matter with you? ain't you satisfied at all
i gave you all you wanted; you was hard jes' like a ball
an' you couldn't hold another bit of puddin'; yet last night
you ached most awful, stummick! that ain't treatin' me jest right

i've been a friend to you, i have! why ain't you a friend o' mine
they gave me castor oil becoz you made me whine
i'm feelin' fine this mornin'; yes it's true
but i tell you, stummick, you better appreciate things i do for you


in the sunshine bright and strong
for this world is fading, pompey
massa won't be with you long
and i fain would hear the south wind
bring once more the sound to me
of the wavelets softly breaking
on the shores of tennessee

as they still the story tell
how no vessels float the banner
that i've loved so long and well
i shall listen to their music
dreaming that again i see
stars and stripes on sloop and shallop
sailing up the tennessee

for death's last dispatch to come
if that exiled starry banner
should come proudly sailing home
you shall greet it, slave no longer
voice and hand shall both be free
that shout and point to union colors
on the waves of tennessee

but old darkey's happy here
where he's tended corn and cotton
for dese many a long-gone year
ober yonder, missis' sleeping
no one tends her grave like me
mebbe she would miss the flowers
she used to love in tennessee

if pompey should beside him stay
mebbe she'd remember better
how for him she used to pray
telling him that way up yonder
white as snow his soul would be
if he served the lord of heaven
while he lived in tennessee

silently the tears were rolling
down the poor old dusky face
as he stepped behind his master
in his long-accustomed place
then a silence fell around them
as they gazed on rock and tree
pictured in the placid waters
of the rolling tennessee

master, dreaming of the battle
where he fought by marion's side
where he bid the haughty tarleton
stoop his lordly crest of pride
man, remembering how yon sleeper
once he held upon his knee
ere she loved the gallant soldier
ralph vervair of tennessee

still the south wind fondly lingers
still the bondman, close beside him
stands behind the old arm-chair
with his dark-hued hand uplifted
shading eyes, he bends to see
where the woodland, boldly jutting
turns aside the tennessee

thus he watches cloud-born shadows
glide from tree to mountain-crest
softly creeping, aye and ever
to the river's yielding breast
ha! above the foliage yonder
something flutters wild and free
the flag's come back to tennessee

help me stand on foot once more
that i may salute the colors
as they pass my cabin door
here's the paper signed that frees you
give a freeman's shout with me
evermore in tennessee

then the trembling voice grew fainter
and the limbs refused to stand
one prayer to jesus--and the soldier
glided to the better land
when the flag went down the river
man and master both were free
while the ring-dove's note was mingled
with the rippling tennessee



it was a hundred years ago
when, by the woodland ways
the traveler saw the wild deer drink
or crop the birchen sprays

beneath a hill, whose rocky side
o'er-browed a grassy mead
and fenced a cottage from the wind
a deer was wont to feed

she only came when on the cliffs
the evening moonlight lay
and no man knew the secret haunts
in which she walked by day

white were her feet, her forehead showed
a spot of silvery white
that seemed to glimmer like a star
in autumn's hazy night

and here, when sang the whippoorwill
she cropped the sprouting leaves
and here her rustling steps were heard
on still october eves

but when the broad midsummer moon
rose o'er the grassy lawn
beside the silver-footed deer
there grazed a spotted fawn

the cottage dame forbade her son
to aim the rifle here
or fright that friendly deer

ten peaceful years and more
and ever, when the moonlight shines
she feeds before our door

a thousand moons ago
they never raise the war whoop here
and never twang the bow

and think that all is well
while such a gentle creature haunts
the place in which we dwell

the youth obeyed, and sought for game
in forests far away
where, deep in silence and in moss
the ancient woodland lay

but once, in autumn's golden time
he ranged the wild in vain
nor roused the pheasant nor the deer
and wandered home again

the crescent moon and crimson eve
shone with a mingling light
the deer, upon the grassy mead
was feeding full in sight

he raised the rifle to his eye
and from the cliffs around
a sudden echo, shrill and sharp
gave back its deadly sound

away, into the neighboring wood
the startled creature flew
and crimson drops at morning lay
amid the glimmering dew

next evening shone the waxing moon
as sweetly as before
the deer upon the grassy mead
was seen again no more

but ere that crescent moon was old
by night the red men came
and burnt the cottage to the ground
and slew the youth and dame

now woods have overgrown the mead
and hid the cliffs from sight
there shrieks the hovering hawk at noon
and prowls the fox at night



where potomac's stream is flowing
virginia's border through
where the white-sailed ships are going
sailing to the ocean blue

hushed the sound of mirth and singing
silent every one
while the solemn bells are ringing
by the tomb of washington

tolling and knelling
with a sad, sweet sound
o'er the waves the tones are swelling
by mount vernon's sacred ground

long ago the warrior slumbered
our country's father slept
long among the angels numbered
they the hero soul have kept

but the children's children love him
and his name revere
so where willows wave above him
sweetly still his knell you hear

sail, oh ships, across the billows
and bear the story far
how he sleeps beneath the willows

tell while sweet adieus are swelling
till you come again
he within the hearts is dwelling
of his loving countrymen



heaven is not reached at a single bound
but we build the ladder by which we rise
from the lowly earth to the vaulted skies
and we mount to the summit round by round

i count this thing to be grandly true
that a noble deed is a step toward god
lifting a soul from the common sod
to a purer air and a broader view

we rise by things that are under our feet
by what we have mastered of good and gain
by the pride deposed and the passion slain
and the vanquished ills that we hourly meet

we hope, we aspire, we resolve, we trust
when the morning calls us to life and light
but our hearts grow weary, and ere he night
our lives are trailing the sordid dust

we hope, we resolve, we aspire, we pray
and we think that we mount the air on wings
beyond the recall of sensual things
while our feet still cling to the heavy clay

only in dreams is a ladder thrown
from the weary earth to the sapphire walls
but the dreams depart, and the vision falls
and the sleeper awakes on his pillow of stone

heaven is not reached at a single bound
but we build the ladder by which we rise
from the lowly earth to the vaulted skies
and we mount to the summit round by round



mr. finney had a turnip
and it grew behind the barn
it grew there, and it grew there
and the turnip did no harm

it grew and it grew
till it could get no taller
mr. finney pulled it up
and put it in his cellar

it lay there and it lay there
till it began to rot
his daughter sallie took it up
and put it in the pot

she boiled it, and she boiled it
as long as she was able
his daughter peggy fished it out
and put it on the table

mr. finney and his wife
they sat down to sup
and they ate, and they ate
until they ate the turnip up


under a spreading chestnut tree
the village smithy stands
the smith, a mighty man is he
with large and sinewy hands
and the muscles of his brawny arms
are strong as iron bands

his hair is crisp, and black and long
his face is like the tan
his brow is wet with honest sweat
he earns whate'er he can
and looks the whole world in the face
for he owes not any man

week in, week out, from morn till night
you can hear his bellows blow
you can hear him swing his heavy sledge
with measured beat and slow
like a sexton ringing the village bell
when the evening sun is low

and children coming home from school
look in at the open door
they love to see the flaming forge
and hear the bellows roar
and catch the burning sparks that fly
like chaff from a threshing floor

he goes on sunday to the church
and sits among his boys
he hears the parson pray and preach
he hears his daughter's voice
singing in the village choir
and it makes his heart rejoice

it sounds to him like her mother's voice
singing in paradise
he needs must think of her once more
how in the grave she lies
and with his hard, rough hand he wipes
a tear out of his eyes

toiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing
onward through life he goes
each morning sees some task begun
each evening sees it close
something attempted, something done
has earned a night's repose

thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend
for the lesson thou hast taught
thus at the flaming forge of life
our fortunes must be wrought
thus on its sounding anvil shaped
each burning deed and thought




every one of you won the war
you and you and you
each one knowing what it was for
and what was his job to do

every one of you won the war
obedient, unwearied, unknown
dung in the trenches, drift on the shore
dust to the world's end blown
every one of you, steady and true
you and you and you
down in the pit or up in the blue
whether you crawled or sailed or flew
whether your closest comrade knew
or you bore the brunt alone

all of you, all of you, name after name
jones and robinson, smith and brown
you from the piping prairie town
you from the fundy fogs that came
you from the city's roaring blocks
you from the bleak new england rocks
with the shingled roof in the apple boughs
you from the brown adobe house
you from the rockies, you from the coast
you from the burning frontier-post
and you from the klondyke's frozen flanks
you from the cedar-swamps, you from the pine
you from the cotton and you from the vine
you from the rice and the sugar-brakes
you from the rivers and you from the lakes
you from the creeks and you from the licks
and you from the brown bayou
you and you and you
you from the pulpit, you from the mine
you from the factories, you from the banks
closer and closer, ranks on ranks
airplanes and cannon, and rifles and tanks
smith and robinson, brown and jones
ruddy faces or bleaching bones
after the turmoil and blood and pain
swinging home to the folks again
or sleeping alone in the fine french rain
every one of you won the war

every one of you won the war
you and you and you
pressing and pouring forth, more and more
toiling and straining from shore to shore
to reach the flaming edge of the dark
where man in his millions went up like a spark
you, in your thousands and millions coming
all the sea ploughed with you, all the air humming
all the land loud with you
all our hearts proud with you
all our souls bowed with the awe of your coming

where's the arch high enough
lads, to receive you
where's the eye dry enough
dears, to perceive you
when at last and at last in your glory you come
tramping home

every one of you won the war
you and you and you
you that carry an unscathed head
you that halt with a broken tread
and oh, most of all, you dead, you dead
lift up the gates for these that are last
that are last in the great procession
let the living pour in, take possession
flood back to the city, the ranch, the farm
the church and the college and mill
back to the office, the store, the exchange
back to the wife with the babe on her arm
back to the mother that waits on the sill
and the supper that's hot on the range

and now, when the last of them all are by
be the gates lifted up on high
to let those others in
those others, their brothers, that softly tread
that come so thick, yet take no ground
that are so many, yet make no sound
our dead, our dead, our dead

o silent and secretly-moving throng
in your fifty thousand strong
coming at dusk when the wreaths have dropt
and streets are empty, and music stopt
silently coming to hearts that wait
dumb in the door and dumb at the gate
and hear your step and fly to your call
every one of you won the war
but you, you dead, most of all



the snow had begun in the gloaming
and busily all the night
had been heaping field and highway
with a silence deep and white

every pine and fir and hemlock
wore ermine too dear for an earl
and the poorest twig on the elm tree
was ridged inch-deep with pearl

from sheds new-roofed with carrara
came chanticleer's muffled crow
the stiff rails were softened to swan's-down
and still fluttered down the snow

i stood and watched by the window
the noiseless work of the sky
and the sudden flurries of snow-birds
like brown leaves whirling by

i thought of a mound in sweet auburn
where a little headstone stood
how the flakes were folding it gently
as did robins the babes in the wood

up spoke our own little mabel
saying, "father, who makes it snow
and i told of the good all-father
who cares for us here below

again i looked at the snow-fall
and thought of the leaden sky
that arched o'er our first great sorrow
when that mound was heaped so high

i remembered the gradual patience
that fell from that cloud like snow
flake by flake, healing and hiding
the scar of our deep-plunged woe

and again to the child i whispered
darling, the merciful father
alone can make it fall

then, with eyes that saw not, i kissed her
and she, kissing back, could not know
that _my_ kiss was given to her sister
folded close under deepening snow




by the rude bridge that arched the flood
their flag to april's breeze unfurled
here once the embattled farmers stood
and fired the shot heard round the world

the foe long since in silence slept
alike the conqueror silent sleeps
and time the ruined bridge has swept
down the dark stream which seaward creeps

on this green bank, by this soft stream
we set to-day a votive stone
that memory may their deed redeem
when, like our sires, our sons are gone

spirit, that made these heroes dare
to die, to leave their children free
bid time and nature gently spare
the shaft we raise to them and thee



it looked extremely rocky for the mudville nine that day
the score stood two to four with but an inning left to play
so, when cooney died at second, and burrows did the same
a pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game

a straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest
with that hope which springs eternal within the human breast
for they thought: "if only casey could get a whack at that
they'd put up even money now, with casey at the bat

but flynn preceded casey, and likewise so did blake
and the former was a puddin', and the latter was a fake
so on that stricken multitude a deathlike silence sat
for there seemed but little chance of casey's getting to the bat

but flynn let drive a "single," to the wonderment of all
and the much-despised blakey "tore the cover off the ball
and when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred
there was blakey safe at second, and flynn a-huggin' third

then, from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell
it rumbled in the mountain-tops, it rattled in the dell
it struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat
for casey, mighty casey, was advancing to the bat

there was ease in casey's manner as he stepped into his place
there was pride in casey's bearing, and a smile on casey's face
and when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat
no stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas casey at the bat

ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt
five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt
then while the new york pitcher ground the ball into his hip
defiance gleamed in casey's eye, a sneer curled casey's lip

and now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air
and casey stood a-watching it in  haughty grandeur there
close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped

from the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar
like the beating of great storm waves on a stern and distant shore
and it's likely they'd have killed him had not casey raised a hand

with a smile of christian charity great casey's visage shone
he stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on
he signaled to sir timothy, once more the spheroid flew
but casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, "strike two

but one scornful look from casey and the audience was awed
they saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain
and they knew that casey wouldn't let that ball go by again

the sneer is gone from casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate
he pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate
and now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go
and now the air is shattered by the force of casey's blow

oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright
the band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light
and somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout
but there is no joy in mudville--mighty casey has struck out




there were saddened hearts in mudville for a week or even more
there were muttered oaths and curses--every fan in town was sore
and then to think he'd go and spring a bush league trick like that

all his past fame was forgotten; he was now a hopeless "shine
they called him "strike-out casey" from the mayor down the line
and as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh
while a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty casey's eye

the lane is long, someone has said, that never turns again
and fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men
and casey smiled--his rugged face no longer wore a frown
the pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town

all mudville has assembled; ten thousand fans had come
to see the twirler who had put big casey on the bum
and when he stepped into the box the multitude went wild
he doffed his cap in proud disdain--but casey only smiled

but in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan
who thought that mudville had a chance; and with the setting sun
their hopes sank low--the rival team was leading "four to one

the last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score
but when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar
the din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard
when the pitcher hit the second and gave "four balls" to the third

three men on base--nobody out--three runs to tie the game
a triple meant the highest niche in mudville's hall of fame
but here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night
when the fourth one "fouled to catcher," and the fifth "flew out to right

a dismal groan in chorus came--a scowl was on each face
when casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place
his bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed; his teeth were clinched in hate
he gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate

but fame is fleeting as the wind, and glory fades away
there were no wild and woolly cheers, no glad acclaim this day
they hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored, "strike him out
but casey gave no outward sign that he had heard the shout

the pitcher smiled and cut one loose; across the plate it spread
another hiss, another groan--"strike one!" the umpire said
zip! like a shot, the second curve broke just below his knee

no roasting for the umpire now--his was an easy lot
but here the pitcher twirled again--was that a rifle shot
a whack; a crack; and out through space the leather pellet flew
a blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue

above the fence in center field, in rapid whirling flight
the sphere sailed on; the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight
ten thousand hats were thrown in air, ten thousand threw a fit
but no one ever found the ball that mighty casey hit

oh, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun
and somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun
and somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall
but mudville hearts are happy now--for casey hit the ball



backward, turn backward, o time, in your flight
make me a child again just for tonight
mother, come back from the echoless shore
take me again to your heart as of yore
kiss from my forehead the furrows of care
smooth the few silver threads out of my hair
over my slumbers your loving watch keep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep

backward, flow backward, o tide of the years
i am so weary of toil and of tears
toil without recompense, tears all in vain
take them, and give me my childhood again
i have grown weary of dust and decay
weary of flinging my soul-wealth away
weary of sowing for others to reap
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep

tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue
mother, o mother, my heart calls for you
many a summer the grass has grown green
blossomed and faded, our faces between
yet with strong yearning and passionate pain
long i to-night for your presence again
come from the silence so long and so deep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep

over my heart, in the days that are flown
no love like mother-love ever has shone
no other worship abides and endures
faithful, unselfish and patient, like yours
none like a mother can charm away pain
from the sick soul and the world-weary brain
slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep

come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold
fall on your shoulders again as of old
let it drop over my forehead to-night
shading my faint eyes away from the light
for with its sunny-edged shadows once more
haply will throng the sweet visions of yore
lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep

mother, dear mother, the years have been long
since i last listened your lullaby song
sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem
womanhood's years have been only a dream
clasped to your breast in a loving embrace
with your light lashes just sweeping my face
never hereafter to wake or to weep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep



my child, ah, my child; thou art weary to-night
thy spirit is sad, and dim is the light
thou wouldst call me back from the echoless shore
to the trials of life, to thy heart as of yore
thou longest again for my fond loving care
for my kiss on thy cheek, for my hand on thy hair
but angels around thee their loving watch keep
and angels, my darling, will rock thee to sleep

gird on thy armor, keep back thy tears
count not thy trials nor efforts in vain
they'll bring thee the light of thy childhood again
thou shouldst not weary, my child, by the way
but watch for the light of that brighter day
not tired of "sowing for others to reap
for angels, my darling, will rock thee to sleep

tired, my child, of the "base, the untrue
i have tasted the cup they have given to you
i've felt the deep sorrow in the living green
of a low mossy grave by the silvery stream
but the dear mother i then sought for in vain
is an angel presence and with me again
and in the still night, from the silence deep
come the bright angels to rock me to sleep

nearer thee now than in days that are flown
purer the love-light encircling thy home
far more enduring the watch for tonight
than ever earth worship away from the light
soon the dark shadows will linger no more
nor come to thy call from the opening door
but know thou, my child, that the angels watch keep
and soon, very soon, they'll rock thee to sleep

they'll sing thee to sleep with a soothing song
and, waking, thou'lt be with a heavenly throng
and thy life, with its toil and its tears and pain
thou wilt then see has not been in vain
thou wilt meet those in bliss whom on earth thou didst love
and whom thou hast taught of the "mansions above
the angels, my darling, will rock thee to sleep



perhaps the day you reck
our boys, the twenty-second maine
kept early's men in check
just where wade hampton boomed away
the fight went neck and neck

all day the weaker wing we held
and held it with a will
five several stubborn times we charged
the battery on the hill
and five times beaten back, re-formed
and kept our column still

at last from out the center fight
spurred up a general's aide
he cried, as past he sped
our colonel simply touched his cap
and then, with measured tread

to lead the crouching line once more
the grand old fellow came
no wounded man but raised his head
and strove to gasp his name
and those who could not speak nor stir

for he was all the world to us
that hero gray and grim
right well we knew that fearful slope
we'd climb with none but him
though while his white head led the way
we'd charge hell's portals in

this time we were not half way up
when, midst the storm of shell
our leader, with his sword upraised
beneath our bayonets fell
and as we bore him back, the foe
set up a joyous yell

our hearts went with him. back we swept
and when the bugle said
but hung his dogged head
the sullen soldiers said

just then before the laggard line
the colonel's horse we spied
bay billy, with his trappings on
his nostrils swelling wide
as though still on his gallant back
the master sat astride

right royally he took the place
that was of old his wont
and with a neigh that seemed to say
above the battle's brunt
if i am not in front

like statues rooted there we stood
and gazed a little space
above that floating mane we missed
the dear familiar face
but we saw bay billy's eye of fire
and it gave us heart of grace

no bugle-call could rouse us all
as that brave sight had done
down all the battered line we felt
a lightning impulse run
up, up the hill we followed bill
and we captured every gun

and when upon the conquered height
died out the battle's hum
vainly 'mid living and the dead
we sought our leader dumb
it seemed as if a spectre steed
to win that day had come

and then the dusk and dew of night
fell softly o'er the plain
as though o'er man's dread work of death
the angels wept again
and drew night's curtain gently round
a thousand beds of pain

all night the surgeons' torches went
the ghastly rows between
all night with solemn step i paced
the torn and bloody green
but who that fought in the big war
such dread sights have not seen

at last the morning broke. the lark
sang in the merry skies
as if to e'en the sleepers there
it said "awake, arise
though naught but that last trump of all
could ope their heavy eyes

and then once more, with banners gay
stretched out the long brigade
trimly upon the furrowed field
the troops stood on parade
and bravely 'mid the ranks were closed
the gaps the fight had made

not half the twenty-second's men
were in their place that morn
and corporal dick, who yester-noon
stood six brave fellows on
now touched my elbow in the ranks
for all between were gone

ah! who forgets that weary hour
when, as with misty eyes
to call the old familiar roll
the solemn sergeant tries
one feels that thumping of the heart
as no prompt voice replies

and as in faltering tone and slow
the last few names were said
across the field some missing horse
toiled up with weary tread
it caught the sergeant's eye, and quick
bay billy's name he read

yes! there the old bay hero stood
all safe from battle's harms
and ere an order could be heard
or the bugle's quick alarms
down all the front, from end to end
the troops presented arms

not all the shoulder-straps on earth
could still our mighty cheer
and ever from that famous day
when rang the roll-call clear
bay billy's name was read, and then
the whole line answered, "here



day by day the organ-builder in his lonely chamber wrought
day by day the soft air trembled to the music of his thought
till at last the work was ended; and no organ voice so grand
ever yet had soared responsive to the master's magic hand

ay, so rarely was it builded that whenever groom and bride
who, in god's sight were well-pleasing, in the church stood side by side
without touch or breath the organ of itself began to play
and the very airs of heaven through the soft gloom seemed to stray

he was young, the organ-builder, and o'er all the land his fame
ran with fleet and eager footsteps, like a swiftly rushing flame
all the maidens heard the story; all the maidens blushed and smiled
by his youth and wondrous beauty and his great renown beguiled

so he sought and won the fairest, and the wedding-day was set
happy day--the brightest jewel in the glad year's coronet
but when they the portal entered, he forgot his lovely bride
forgot his love, forgot his god, and his heart swelled high with pride

how the vast cathedral-arches will re-echo with my praise
up the aisle the gay procession moved. the altar shone afar
with every candle gleaming through soft shadows like a star

but he listened, listened, listened, with no thought of love or prayer
for the swelling notes of triumph from his organ standing there
all was silent. nothing heard he save the priest's low monotone
and the bride's robe trailing softly o'er the floor of fretted stone

then his lips grew white with anger. surely god was pleased with him
who had built the wondrous organ for his temple vast and dim
whose the fault then? hers--the maiden standing meekly at his side
flamed his jealous rage, maintaining she was false to him--his bride

vain were all her protestations, vain her innocence and truth
on that very night he left her to her anguish and her ruth
far he wandered to a country wherein no man knew his name
for ten weary years he dwelt there, nursing still his wrath and shame

then his haughty heart grew softer, and he thought by night and day
of the bride he had deserted, till he hardly dared to pray
thought of her, a spotless maiden, fair and beautiful and good
thought of his relentless anger, that had cursed her womanhood

till his yearning grief and penitence at last were all complete
and he longed, with bitter longing, just to fall down at her feet
ah! how throbbed his heart when, after many a weary day and night
rose his native towers before him, with the sunset glow alight

through the gates into the city on he pressed with eager tread
there he met a long procession--mourners following the dead
why do yonder sorrowing maidens scatter flowers along the way

and because her days were given to the service of god's poor
from his church we mean to bury her. see! yonder is the door

no one knew him; no one wondered when he cried out, white with pain
no one questioned when, with pallid lips, he poured his tears like rain
as he made his way unchallenged, and bore the coffin's head

bore it through the open portal, bore it up the echoing aisle
let it down before the altar, where the lights burned clear the while
when, oh, hark; the wondrous organ of itself began to play
strains of rare, unearthly sweetness never heard until that day

all the vaulted arches rang with music sweet and clear
all the air was filled with glory, as of angels hovering near
and ere yet the strain was ended, he who bore the coffin's head
with the smile of one forgiven, gently sank beside it--dead

they who raised the body knew him, and they laid him by his bride
down the aisle and o'er the threshold they were carried, side by side
while the organ played a dirge that no man ever heard before
and then softly sank to silence--silence kept forevermore



a fellow just a thing or two
you've had a furlough, been to see
how all the folks in jersey do
it's months ago since i was there
i, and a bullet from fair oaks
when you were home, old comrade, say
did you see any of our folks

for if i do look grim and rough
i've got some feelin
people think
a soldier's heart is mighty tough
but, harry, when the bullets fly
and hot saltpetre flames and smokes
while whole battalions lie afield
one's apt to think about his folks

the old man--is he hearty yet
and mother--does she fade at all
or does she seem to pine and fret
for me? and sis?--has she grown tall
and did you see her friend--you know
that annie moss
where did you see her?--tell: me, hal
a lot of news about our folks

it's likely, for they're always there
not sunday? no? a funeral? who
who, harry? how you shake and stare
all well, you say, and all were out
what ails you, hal? is this a hoax
why don't you tell me like a man
what is the matter with our folks

i say all well, for he knows best
who takes the young ones in his arms
before the sun goes to the west
the axe-man death deals right and left
and flowers fall as well as oaks
and so
fair annie blooms no more
and that's the matter with your folks

and this white blossom from her breast
and here--your sister bessie wrote
a letter telling all the rest
bear up, old friend
nobody speaks
only the old camp-raven croaks
and soldiers whisper, "boys, be still
there's some bad news from granger's folks

he turns his back--the only foe
that ever saw it--on this grief
and, as men will, keeps down the tears
kind nature sends to woe's relief
then answers he: "ah, hal, i'll try
but in my throat there's something chokes
because, you see, i've thought so long
to count her in among our folks

but still i will keep thinking, too
i could have kept all trouble off
by being tender, kind and true
but maybe not
she's safe up there
and when the hand deals other strokes
she'll stand by heaven's gate, i know
and wait to welcome in our folks



which well-nigh filled joe's bar-room on the corner of the square
and as songs and witty stories came through the open door
a vagabond crept slowly in and posed upon the floor

i wouldn't touch him with a fork, he's as filthy as a turk

this badinage the poor wretch took with stoical, good grace
in fact, he smiled as though he thought he'd struck the proper place
to be in such good company would make a deacon proud

when i had cash to treat the gang, this hand was never slow
what? you laugh as though you thought this pocket never held a sou
i once was fixed as well, my boys, as any one of you

next time i pass this good saloon, i'll make another call
my voice is cracked, my throat's worn out, and my lungs are going fast

i'll tell you a funny story, and a fact, i promise, too
that i was ever a decent man, not one of you would think
but i was, some four or five years back. say, give me another drink

such little drinks, to a bum like me, are miserably tame
five fingers--there, that's the scheme--and corking whisky, too
well, here's luck, boys; and landlord, my best regards to you

i came to be the dirty sot you see before you now
as i told you, once i was a man, with muscle, frame and health
and but for a blunder, ought to have made considerable wealth

but an artist, and, for my age, was rated pretty good
i worked hard at my canvas, and was bidding fair to rise
for gradually i saw the star of fame before my eyes

it brought me fifteen hundred pounds, and added to my name
and then i met a woman--now comes the funny part
with eyes that petrified my brain and sunk into my heart

could ever love a woman, and expect her love for me
but 'twas so, and for a month or two her smiles were freely given
and when her loving lips touched mine it carried me to heaven

with a form like the milo venus, too beautiful to live
with eyes that would beat the koh-i-noor, and a wealth of chestnut hair
if so, 'twas she, for there never was another half so fair

of a fair-haired boy, a friend of mine, who lived across the way
and madeline admired it, and, much to my surprise
said that she'd like to know the man that had such dreamy eyes

my friend had stolen my darling, and i was left alone
and ere a year of misery had passed above my head
the jewel i had treasured so had tarnished, and was dead

i thought you'd be amused, and laughing all the while
why, what's the mattter, friend? there's a teardrop in your eye
come, laugh, like me; 'tis only babes and women that should cry

and i'll draw right here a picture of the face that drove me mad
give me that piece of chalk with which you mark the baseball score
you shall see the lovely madeline upon the bar-room floor

another drink, and, with chalk in hand, the vagabond began
to sketch a face that well might buy the soul of any man
then as he placed another lock upon the shapely head
with a fearful shriek, he leaped, and fell across the picture dead



one day through the primeval wood
a calf walked home, as good calves should
but made a trail all bent askew
a crooked trail, as all calves do
since then three hundred years have fled
and, i infer, the calf is dead

but still he left behind his trail
and thereby hangs a moral tale
the trail was taken up next day
by a lone dog that passed that way
and then the wise bell-wether sheep
pursued the trail o'er vale and steep
and drew the flock behind him, too
as good bell-wethers always do
and from that day, o'er hill and glade
through those old woods a path was made

and many men wound in and out
and turned and dodged and bent about
and uttered words of righteous wrath
because 'twas such a crooked path
but still they followed--do not laugh
the first migrations of that calf
and through this winding woodway stalked
because he wabbled when he walked

this forest path became a lane
that bent and turned and turned again
this crooked path became a road
where many a poor horse, with his load
toiled on beneath the burning sun
and traveled some three miles in one
and thus a century and a half
they trod the footsteps of that calf

the years passed on in swiftness fleet
the road became a village street
and this, before men were aware
a city's crowded thoroughfare
and soon the central street was this
of a renowned metropolis
and men two centuries and a half
trod in the footsteps of that calf

each day a hundred thousand rout
followed the zigzag calf about
and o'er his crooked journey went
the traffic of a continent
a hundred thousand men were led
by a calf near three centuries dead
they followed still his crooked way
and lost one hundred years a day
for thus such reverence is lent
to well-established precedent

a moral lesson this might teach
were i ordained and called to preach
for men are prone to go it blind
along the calf-paths of the mind
and work away from sun to sun
to do what other men have done
they follow in the beaten track
and out and in, and forth and back
and still their devious course pursue
to keep the path that others do
but how the wise wood-gods must laugh
who saw the first primeval calf
ah, many things this tale might teach
but i am not ordained to preach



paul revere was a rider bold
well has his valorous deed been told
sheridan's ride was a glorious one
often it has been dwelt upon
but why should men do all the deeds
on which the love of a patriot feeds
hearken to me, while i reveal
the dashing ride of jennie m'neal

on a spot as pretty as might be found
in the dangerous length of the neutral ground
in a cottage, cozy, and all their own
she and her mother lived alone
safe were the two, with their frugal store
from all of the many who passed their door
for jennie's mother was strange to fears
and jennie was large for fifteen years
with vim her eyes were glistening
her hair was the hue of a blackbird's wing
and while the friends who knew her well
the sweetness of her heart could tell
a gun that hung on the kitchen wall
looked solemnly quick to heed her call
and they who were evil-minded knew
her nerve was strong and her aim was true
so all kind words and acts did deal
to generous, black-eyed jennie m'neal

one night, when the sun had crept to bed
and rain-clouds lingered overhead
and sent their surly drops for proof
to drum a tune on the cottage roof
close after a knock at the outer door
there entered a dozen dragoons or more
their red coats, stained by the muddy road
that they were british soldiers showed
the captain his hostess bent to greet
saying, "madam, please give us a bit to eat
we will pay you well, and, if may be
this bright-eyed girl for pouring our tea
then we must dash ten miles ahead
to catch a rebel colonel abed
he is visiting home, as doth appear
we will make his pleasure cost him dear
and they fell on the hasty supper with zeal
close-watched the while by jennie m'neal

for the gray-haired colonel they hovered near
had been her true friend, kind and dear
and oft, in her younger days, had he
right proudly perched her upon his knee
and told her stories many a one
concerning the french war lately done
and oft together the two friends were
and many the arts he had taught to her
she had hunted by his fatherly side
he had shown her how to fence and ride
and once had said, "the time may be
your skill and courage may stand by me
so sorrow for him she could but feel
brave, grateful-hearted jennie m'neal

with never a thought or a moment more
bare-headed she slipped from the cottage door
ran out where the horses were left to feed
unhitched and mounted the captain's steed
and down the hilly and rock-strewn way
she urged the fiery horse of gray
around her slender and cloakless form
pattered and moaned the ceaseless storm
secure and tight a gloveless hand
grasped the reins with stern command
and full and black her long hair streamed
whenever the ragged lightning gleamed
and on she rushed for the colonel's weal
brave, lioness-hearted jennie m'neal

hark! from the hills, a moment mute
came a clatter of hoofs in hot pursuit
and a cry from the foremost trooper said
she heeded it not, and not in vain
she lashed the horse with the bridle-rein

so into the night the gray horse strode
his shoes hewed fire from the rocky road
and the high-born courage that never dies
flashed from his rider's coal-black eyes
the pebbles flew from the fearful race
the raindrops grasped at her glowing face
cried eager, resolute jennie m'neal

then, no one answering to the calls
sped after her a volley of balls
they passed her in her rapid flight
they screamed to her left, they screamed to her right
but, rushing still o'er the slippery track
she sent no token of answer back
except a silvery laughter-peal
brave, merry-hearted jennie m'neal

so on she rushed, at her own good will
through wood and valley, o'er plain and hill
the gray horse did his duty well
till all at once he stumbled and fell
himself escaping the nets of harm
but flinging the girl with a broken arm
still undismayed by the numbing pain
she clung to the horse's bridle-rein
and gently bidding him to stand
petted him with her able hand
then sprung again to the saddle bow
and shouted, "one more trial now
as if ashamed of the heedless fall
he gathered his strength once more for all
and, galloping down a hillside steep
gained on the troopers at every leap
no more the high-bred steed did reel
but ran his best for jennie m'neal

they were a furlong behind, or more
when the girl burst through the colonel's door
her poor arm helpless hanging with pain
and she all drabbled and drenched with rain
but her cheeks as red as fire-brands are
and her eyes as bright as a blazing star
and shouted, "quick! be quick, i say
they come! they come! away! away
then, sunk on the rude white floor of deal
poor, brave, exhausted jennie m'neal

the startled colonel sprung, and pressed
the wife and children to his breast
and turned away from his fireside bright
and glided into the stormy night
then soon and safely made his way
to where the patriot army lay
but first he bent in the dim firelight
and kissed the forehead broad and white
and blessed the girl who had ridden so well
to keep him out of a prison-cell
the girl roused up at the martial din
just as the troopers came rushing in
and laughed, e'en in the midst of a moan
saying, "good sirs, your bird has flown
so deal with me now as you think best
but the grand young captain bowed, and said
of womankind i must crown you queen
so brave a girl i have never seen
wear this gold ring as your valor's due
and when peace comes i will come for you
but jennie's face an arch smile wore
as she said, "there's a lad in putnam's corps
who told me the same, long time ago
you two would never agree, i know
i promised my love to be as true as steel
said good, sure-hearted jennie m'neal



they say that man is mighty, he governs land and sea
he wields a mighty scepter o'er lesser powers that be
by a mightier power and stronger, man from his throne is hurled
and the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world

blessings on the hand of woman! angels guard its strength and grace
in the palace, cottage, hovel, oh, no matter where the place
would that never storms assailed it, rainbows ever gently curled
for the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world

infancy's the tender fountain, power may with beauty flow
mother's first to guide the streamlets, from them souls unresting grow
grow on for the good or evil, sunshine streamed or darkness hurled
for the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world

woman, how divine your mission here upon our natal sod
keep, oh, keep the young heart open always to the breath of god
all true trophies of the ages are from mother-love impearled
for the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world

blessings on the hand of woman! fathers, sons and daughters cry
and the sacred song is mingled with the worship in the sky
mingles where no tempest darkens, rainbows evermore are curled
for the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world



i live for those who love me
whose hearts are kind and true
for the heaven that smiles above me
and awaits my spirit, too
for the human ties that bind me
for the task by god assigned me
for the bright hopes left behind me
and the good that i can do

i live to learn their story
who've suffered for my sake
to emulate their glory
and to follow in their wake
bards, patriots, martyrs, sages
the noble of all ages
whose deeds crowd history's pages
and time's great volume make

i live to hold communion
with all that is divine
to feel there is a union
to profit by affliction
reap truths from fields of fiction
grow wiser from conviction
and fulfill each grand design

i live to hail that season
by gifted minds foretold
when men shall rule by reason
and not alone by gold
when man to man united
and every wrong thing righted
the whole world shall be lighted
as eden was of old

i live for those who love me
for those who know me true
for the heaven that smiles above me
and awaits my spirit, too
for the cause that lacks assistance
for the wrong that needs resistance
for the future in the distance
and the good that i can do



if all the ships i have at sea
should come a-sailing home to me
weighed down with gems, and silk and gold
ah! well, the harbor would not hold
so many ships as there would be
if all my ships came home from sea

if half my ships came home from sea
and brought their precious freight to me
ah! well, i should have wealth as great
as any king that sits in state
so rich the treasure there would be
in half my ships now out at sea

if but one ship i have at sea
should come a-sailing home to me
ah! well, the storm clouds then might frown
for, if the others all went down
still rich and glad and proud i'd be
if that one ship came home to me

if that one ship went down at sea
and all the others came to me
weighed down with gems and wealth untold
with honor, riches, glory, gold
the poorest soul on earth i'd be
if that one ship came not to me

o skies, be calm; o winds, blow free
blow all my ships safe home to me
but if thou sendest some awrack
to nevermore come sailing back
send any, all that skim the sea
but send my love ship home to me




god made man in his own image; in the image of god made he

bowed by the weight of centuries he leans
upon his hoe and gazes on the ground
the emptiness of ages in his face
and on his back the burden of the world
who made him dead to rapture and despair
a thing that grieves not and that never hopes
stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox
who loosened and let down this brutal jaw
whose was the hand that slanted back this brow
whose breath blew out the light within this brain
is this the thing, the lord god made and gave
to have dominion over sea and land
to trace the stars and search the heavens for power
to feel the passion of eternity
is this the dream he dreamed who shaped the suns
and pillared the blue firmament with light
down all the stretch of hell to its last gulf
there is no shape more terrible than this
more tongued with censure of the world's blind greed
more filled with signs and portents for the soul
more fraught with menace to the universe

what gulfs between him and the seraphim
slave of the wheel of labor, what to him
are plato and the swing of pleiades
what the long reaches of the peaks of song
the rift of dawn, the reddening of the rose
through this dread shape the suffering ages look
time's tragedy is in that aching stoop
through this dread shape humanity betrayed
plundered, profaned and disinherited
cries protest to the judges of the world
a protest that is also prophecy

o masters, lords and rulers in all lands
is this the handiwork you give to god
this monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched
how will you ever straighten up this shape
touch it again with immortality
give back the upward looking and the light
rebuild it in the music and the dream
make right the immemorial infamies, perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes

o masters, lords and rulers in all lands
how will the future reckon with this man
how answer his brute question in that hour
when whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world
how will it be with kingdom and with kings
with those who shaped him to the thing he is
when this dumb terror shall reply to god
after the silence of the centuries



did you say you wished to see me, sir? step in; 'tis a cheerless place
but you're heartily welcome all the same; to be poor is no disgrace
have i been here long? oh, yes, sir! 'tis thirty winters gone
since poor jim took to crooked ways and left me all alone
jim was my son, and a likelier lad you'd never wish to see
till evil counsels won his heart and led him away from me

and men go down--and down--and down--to blackness and despair
tossing about like wrecks at sea, with helm and anchor lost
on and on, through the surging waves, nor caring to count the cost
i doubt sometimes if the savior sees, he seems so far away
how the souls he loved and died for, are drifting--drifting astray

indeed,'tis little wonder, sir, if woman shrinks and cries
when the life-blood on rum's altar spilled is calling to the skies
small wonder if her own heart feels each sacrificial blow
for isn't each life a part of hers? each pain her hurt and woe
read all the records of crime and shame--'tis bitterly, sadly true
where manliness and honor die, there some woman's heart dies, too

i often think, when i hear folks talk so prettily and so fine
of "alcohol as needful food"; of the "moderate use of wine
how "the world couldn't do without it, there was clearly no other way
but for a man to drink, or let it alone, as his own strong will might say
that "to use it, but not abuse it, was the proper thing to do
how i wish they'd let old poorhouse nan preach her little sermon, too

i would give them scenes in a woman's life that would make their
pulses stir
for i was a drunkard's child and wife--aye, a drunkard's mother, sir
i would tell of childish terrors, of childish tears and pain
of cruel blows from a father's hand when rum had crazed his brain
he always said he could drink his fill, or let it alone as well
perhaps he might, he was killed one night in a brawl--in a grog-shop hell

i would tell of years of loveless toil the drunkard's child had passed
with just one gleam of sunshine, too beautiful to last
when i married tom i thought for sure i had nothing more to fear
that life would come all right at last; the world seemed full of cheer
but he took to moderate drinking--he allowed 'twas a harmless thing
so the arrow sped, and my bird of hope came down with a broken wing

tom was only a moderate drinker; ah, sir, do you bear in mind
how the plodding tortoise in the race left the leaping hare behind
and that's the way, i'm thinking, that the moderate drinkers go
step over step--day after day--with sleepless, tireless pace
while the toper sometimes looks behind and tarries in the race

ah, heavily in the well-worn path poor tom walked day by day
for my heart-strings clung about his feet and tangled up the way
the days were dark, and friends were gone, and life dragged on full slow
and children came, like reapers, and to a harvest of want and woe
two of them died, and i was glad when they lay before me dead
i had grown so weary of their cries--their pitiful cries for bread

there came a time when my heart was stone; i could neither hope nor pray
poor tom lay out in the potter's field, and my boy had gone astray
my boy who'd been my idol, while, like hound athirst for blood
between my breaking heart and him the liquor seller stood
and lured him on with pleasant words, his pleasures and his wine
ah, god have pity on other hearts as bruised and hurt as mine

there were whispers of evil-doing, of dishonor, and of shame
that i cannot bear to think of now, and would not dare to name
there was hiding away from the light of day, there was creeping about at
night
a hurried word of parting--then a criminal's stealthy flight
his lips were white with remorse and fright when he gave me a good-by kiss
and i've never seen my poor lost boy from that black day to this

ah, none but a mother can tell you, sir, how a mother's heart will ache
with the sorrow that comes of a sinning child, with grief for a lost one's
when she knows the feet she trained to walk have gone so far astray
and the lips grown bold with curses that she taught to sing and pray
a child may fear--a wife may weep, but of all sad things, none other
seems half so sorrowful to me as being a drunkard's mother

they tell me that down in the vilest dens of the city's crime and murk
there are men with the hearts of angels, doing the angels' work
that they win back the lost and the straying, that they help the weak to
stand
by the wonderful power of loving words--and the help of god's right hand
and often and often, the dear lord knows, i've knelt and prayed to him
that somewhere, somehow, 'twould happen that they'd find and save my jim

you'll say 'tis a poor old woman's whim; but when i prayed last night
right over yon eastern window there shone a wonderful light
the softest voice i had ever heard: it rung like a silver bell
and these were the words, "the prodigal turns, so tired by want and sin
he seeks his father's open door--he weeps--and enters in

why, sir, you're crying as hard as i; what--is it really done
have the loving voice and the helping hand brought back my wandering son
did you kiss me and call me "mother"--and hold me to your breast
or is it one of the taunting dreams that come to mock my rest
no--no! thank god, 'tis a dream come true! i can die, for he's saved
my boy
and the poor old heart that had lived on grief was broken at last by joy



oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud
like a swift fleeting meteor, a fast flying cloud
a flash of the lightning, a break of the wave
he passes from life to his rest in the grave

the leaves of the oak and the willows shall fade
be scattered around, and together be laid
and the young and the old, and the low and the high
shall moulder to dust, and together shall die

the child whom a mother attended and loved
the mother that infant's affection who proved
the husband that mother and infant who blessed
each--all are away to their dwelling of rest

the maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye
shone beauty and pleasure--her triumphs are by
and the memory of those who loved her and praised
are alike from the minds of the living erased

the hand of the king who the scepter hath borne
the brow of the priest who the mitre hath worn
the eye of the sage and the heart of the brave
are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave

the peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap
the herdsman who climbed with his goats to the steep
the beggar who wandered in search of his bread
have faded away like the grass that we tread

the saint who enjoyed the communion of heaven
the sinner who dared to remain unforgiven
the wise and the foolish, the guilty and just
have quietly mingled their bones in the dust

so the multitude goes--like the flower and the weed
that wither away to let others succeed
so the multitude comes--even those we behold
to repeat every tale that has often been told

for we are the same things that our fathers have been
we see the same sights that our fathers have seen
we drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun
and we run the same course that our fathers have run

the thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think
from the death we are shrinking from, they too would shrink
to the life we are clinging to, they too would cling
but it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing

they loved--but their story we cannot enfold
they scorned--but the heart of the haughty is cold
they grieved--but no wail from their slumbers may come
they joy'd--but the voice of their gladness--is dumb

they died, ay, they died! and we things that are now
who walk on the turf that lies over their brow
who make in their dwellings a transient abode
meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road

yea, hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain
are mingled together in sunshine and rain
and the smile, and the tear, and the song and the dirge
still follow each other like surge upon surge

from the blossoms of health to the paleness of death
from the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud
oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud



that blazed before fort sumter had wakened the north as one
long ere the wondrous pillar of battle-cloud and fire
had marked where the unchained millions marched on to their heart's desire
on roofs and glittering turrets, that night, as the sun went down
the mellow glow of the twilight shone like a jeweled crown
and, bathed in the living glory, as the people lifted their eyes
they saw the pride of the city, the spire of st. michael's rise
high over the lesser steeples, tipped with a golden ball
that hung like a radiant planet caught in its earthward fall
first glimpse of home to the sailor who made the harbor round
and last slow-fading vision dear to the outward bound
the gently gathering shadows shut out the waning light
the children prayed at their bedsides as they were wont each night
the noise of buyer and seller from the busy mart was gone
and in dreams of a peaceful morrow the city slumbered on

but another light than sunrise aroused the sleeping street
for a cry was heard at midnight, and the rush of trampling feet
men stared in each other's faces, thro' mingled fire and smoke
while the frantic bells went clashing clamorous, stroke on stroke
by the glare of her blazing roof-tree the houseless mother fled
with the babe she pressed to her bosom shrieking in nameless dread
while the fire-king's wild battalions scaled wall and cap-stone high
and painted their glaring banners against an inky sky
from the death that raged behind them, and the crush of ruin loud
to the great square of the city, were driven the surging crowd
where yet firm in all the tumult, unscathed by the fiery flood
with its heavenward pointing finger the church of st. michael's stood

but e'en as they gazed upon it there rose a sudden wail
a cry of horror blended with the roaring of the gale
on whose scorching wings updriven, a single flaming brand
aloft on the towering steeple clung like a bloody hand
far out on the lurid harbor they watched it from the ships
a baleful gleam, that brighter and ever brighter shone
like a flickering, trembling will-o'-the-wisp to a steady beacon grown
for the love of the periled city, plucks down yon burning brand
so cried the mayor of charleston, that all the people heard
but they looked each one at his fellow, and no man spoke a word
who is it leans from the belfry, with face upturned to the sky
clings to a column and measures the dizzy spire with his eye
will he dare it, the hero undaunted, that terrible, sickening height
or will the hot blood of his courage freeze in his veins at the sight
but see! he has stepped on the railing, he climbs with his feet and his
hands
and firm on a narrow projection, with the belfry beneath him, he stands
now once, and once only, they cheer him--a single tempestuous breath
and there falls on the multitude gazing a hush like the stillness of death

slow, steadily mounting, unheeding aught save the goal of the fire
still higher and higher, an atom, he moves on the face of the spire
he stops! will he fall? lo! for answer, a gleam like a meteor's track
and, hurled on the stones of the pavement, the red brand lies shattered and
black
once more the shouts of the people have rent the quivering air
at the church door mayor and council wait with their feet on the stair
and the eager throng behind them press for a touch of his hand
the unknown savior whose daring could compass a deed so grand

but why does a sudden tremor seize on them as they gaze
and what meaneth that stifled murmur of wonder and amaze
he stood in the gate of the temple he had periled his life to save
and the face of the unknown hero was the sable face of a slave
with folded arms he was speaking in tones that were clear, not loud
and his eyes, ablaze in their sockets, burnt into the eyes of the crowd
if the deed i have done before you be not the deed of a _man

he stepped but a short space backward, and from all the women and men
there were only sobs for answer, and the mayor called for a pen
and the great seal of the city, that he might read who ran
and the slave who saved st. michael's went out from its door a man



a soldier of the legion lay dying in algiers
there was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's tears
but a comrade stood beside him, while his life-blood ebbed away
and bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say
the dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade's hand
and he said, "i never more shall see my own, my native land
take a message, and a token, to some distant friends of mine
for i was born at bingen--at bingen on the rhine

to hear my mournful story in the pleasant vineyard ground
that we fought the battle bravely, and when the day was done
full many a corpse lay ghastly pale, beneath the setting sun
and 'midst the dead and dying, were some grown old in wars
the death-wound on their gallant breasts the last of many scars
but some were young--and suddenly beheld life's morn decline
and one had come from bingen--fair bingen on the rhine

and i was aye a truant bird, that thought his home a cage
for my father was a soldier, and even as a child
my heart leaped forth to hear him tell of struggles fierce and wild
and when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard
i let them take whate'er they would, but kept my father's sword
and with boyish love i hung it where the bright light used to shine
on the cottage-wall at bingen--calm bingen on the rhine

when the troops are marching home again with glad and gallant tread
but to look upon them proudly, with a calm and steadfast eye
for her brother was a soldier too, and not afraid to die
and if a comrade seek her love, i ask her in my name
to listen to him kindly, without regret or shame
and to hang the old sword in its place (my father's sword and mine
for the honor of old bingen--dear bingen on the rhine

you'd have known her by the merriment that sparkled in her eye
too innocent for coquetry--too fond for idle scorning
oh, friend! i fear the lightest heart makes sometimes heaviest mourning
tell her the last night of my life (for ere the moon be risen
my body will be out of pain--my soul be out of prison
i dreamed i stood with her, and saw the yellow sunlight shine
on the vine-clad hills of bingen--fair bingen on the rhine

the german songs we used to sing, in chorus sweet and clear
and down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill
the echoing chorus sounded, through the evening calm and still
and her glad blue eyes were on me as we passed with friendly talk
down many a path beloved of yore, and well-remembered walk
and her little hand lay lightly, confidingly in mine
but we'll meet no more at bingen--loved bingen on the rhine

his voice grew faint and hoarser,--his grasp was childish weak
his eyes put on a dying look,--he sighed and ceased to speak
his comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled
the soldier of the legion, in a foreign land--was dead
and the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down
on the red sand of the battle-field, with bloody corpses strown
yea, calmly on that dreadful scene her pale light seemed to shine
as it shone on distant bingen--fair bingen on the rhine



on a board of bright mosaic wrought in many a quaint design
gleam a brace of silver goblets wreathed with flowers and filled with wine
round the board a group is seated; here and there are threads of white
which their dark locks lately welcomed; but they're only boys tonight
some whose words have thrilled the senate, some who win the critic's
praise
all are "chums" to-night, with voices redolent of college days

how we used to fill our oil cans and repair to 'no. 9
but at last the old professor--never long was he outdone
opened up our shining oil cans and demolished all our fun
in the laugh that rings so gayly through the richly curtained room
join they all, save one; why is it? does he see the waxen bloom
tremble in its vase of silver? does he see the ruddy wine
shiver in its crystal goblet, or do those grave eyes divine
something sadder yet? he pauses till their mirth has died away
then in measured tones speaks gravely
worthily your praise
it is bitter fruitage ripened from our pranks of college days

with his flexible voice would garnish any tale, whate'er it be

at the san francisco l---- house, when i heard a plaintive moan
sounding from the room adjoining. hoping to give some relief
to the suffering one, i entered; but it thrilled my heart with grief
just to see that wreck of manhood--bloated face, disheveled hair
wildly tossing, ever moaning, while his thin hands beat the air
broken prayers, vile oaths and curses filled the air as i drew near
then in faint and piteous accents, these words i could plainly hear
then i'll follow where they lead me, be it to the depths of hell
when he saw me he grew calmer, started strangely--looked me o'er
oh, the glory of expression! i had seen those eyes before
yes, i knew him; it was horace, he who won the college prize
naught remained of his proud beauty but the splendor of his eyes
he whom we were all so proud of, lay there in the fading light
if my years should number fourscore, i shall ne'er forget that sight
and he knew me--called me 'albert,' ere a single word i'd said
we were comrades in the old days; i sat down beside the bed

he kept talking of our boyhood while my hand he still would keep
in his own so white and wasted, and with burning eyes would gaze
on my face, still talking feebly of the dear old college days
but a poor degraded outcast--hopes, ambition swept away
and it dates back to those oil cans that we filled in greatest glee
little did i think in those days what the harvest now would be

wrings my heart, burst from his white lips, though his teeth were tightly
and with sudden strength he started--sprang from my detaining arm
shrieking wildly, 'curse the demons; do they think to do me harm
back! i say, ye forked-tongued serpents reeking with the filth of hell
don't ye see i have her with me--my poor sainted little belle

my head down, 'oh, al,' he whispered, 'such remorse you never knew
and again i tried to soothe him, but my eyes o'erbrimmed with tears
his were dry and clear, as brilliant as they were in college years
all the flush had left his features, he lay white as marble now
tenderly i smoothed his pillow, wiped the moisture from his brow
though i begged him to be quiet, he would talk of those old days
brokenly at times, but always of 'the boys' with loving praise

you remember rena barstow. when i asked if she were dead
but i wish, to god, it were so, and i still might call her mine
she's divorced--she's mine no longer,' here his voice grew weak and hoarse
i've a little girl in heaven, playing round the savior's knee
always patient and so faithful that at last she died for me

every one had lost hope in me but my faithful little child
she would say, "now stop, dear papa, for i know you can stop _now
i would promise, kiss my darling, and the next day break my vow
so it went until one christmas, dark and stormy, cold and drear
out i started, just as usual, for the cursed rum shop near
and my darling followed after, in the storm of rain and sleet
with no covering wrapped about her, naught but slippers on her feet
no one knew it, no one missed her, till there came with solemn tread
stern-faced men unto our dwelling, bringing back our darling--_dead
they had found her cold and lifeless, like, they said, an angel fair
leaning 'gainst the grog shop window--oh, she thought that _i was there
then he raised his arms toward heaven, called aloud unto the dead
for his mind again was wandering: 'belle, my precious belle!' he said
all the way--alone--my darling--just to lead--poor--papa--home
and he surely had an answer, for a silence o'er him fell
and i sat alone and lonely--death had come with little belle

silence in that princely parlor--head of every guest is bowed
they still see the red wine sparkle, but 'tis through a misty cloud
said the host at last, arising, "i have scorned the pledge to sign
laughed at temperance all my life long. never more shall drop of wine
touch my lips. the fruit _was_ bitter, boys; 'twas i proposed it first
that foul joke from which poor horace ever bore a life accurst
let us pledge ourselves to-night, boys, never more by word, or deed
in our own fair homes, or elsewhere, help to plant the poison seed

silence once again, but only for a moment's space, and then
in one voice they all responded with a low and firm "amen



the summer and autumn had been so wet
that in winter the corn was growing yet
the grain lie rotting on the ground

every day the starving poor
crowded round bishop hatto's door
for he had a plentiful last year's store
and all the neighborhood could tell
his granaries were furnish'd well

at last bishop hatto appointed a day
to quiet the poor without delay
he bade them to his great barn repair
and they should have food for the winter there

rejoiced the tidings good to hear
the poor folk flock'd from far and near
the great barn was full as it could hold
of women and children, and young and old

then, when he saw it could hold no more
bishop hatto he made fast the door
and while for mercy on christ they call
he set fire to the barn and burnt them all

for ridding it, in these times forlorn
of rats that only consume the corn

so then to his palace returned he
and he sat down to supper merrily
and he slept that night like an innocent man
but bishop hatto never slept again

in the morning, as he enter'd the hall
where his picture hung against the wall
a sweat like death all over him came
for the rats had eaten it out of the frame

as he look'd, there came a man from his farm
he had a countenance white with alarm
and the rats had eaten all your corn

another came running presently
and he was pale as pale could be
the lord forgive you for yesterday

the walls are high, and the shores are steep
and the stream is strong, and the water deep

bishop hatto fearfully hasten'd away
and he cross'd the rhine without delay
and reach'd his tower and barr'd with care
all the windows, doors, and loopholes there

he laid him down and closed his eyes
but soon a scream made him arise
he started, and saw two eyes of flame
on his pillow, from whence the screaming came

he listen'd and look'd,--it was only the cat
but the bishop he grew more fearful for that
for she sat screaming, mad with fear
at the army of rats that were drawing near

for they have swum over the river so deep
and they have climb'd the shores so steep
and up the tower their way is bent
to do the work for which they were sent

they are not to be told by the dozen or score
by thousands they come, and by myriads and more
such numbers had never been heard of before
such a judgment had never been witness'd of yore

down on his knees the bishop fell
and faster and faster his beads did he tell
as louder and louder, drawing near
the gnawing of their teeth he could hear

and in at the windows and in at the door
and through the walls helter-skelter they pour
and down from the ceiling and up through the floor

from the right and the left, from behind and before
from within and without, from above and below
and all at once to the bishop they go

they have whetted their teeth against the stones
and now they pick the bishop's bones
they gnaw'd the flesh from every limb
for they were sent to do judgment on him



the sabbath day was ending in a village by the sea
the uttered benediction touched the people tenderly
and they rose to face the sunset in the glowing, lighted west
and then hastened to their dwellings for god's blessed boon of rest

bat they looked across the waters, and a storm was raging there
a fierce spirit moved above them--the wild spirit of the air
and it lashed and shook and tore them till they thundered, groaned and
boomed
and, alas! for any vessel in their yawning gulfs entombed

very anxious were the people on that rocky coast of wales
lest the dawn of coming morrow should be telling awful tales
when the sea had spent its passion and should cast upon the shore
bits of wreck and swollen victims as it had done heretofore

with the rough winds blowing round her, a brave woman strained her eyes
as she saw along the billows a large vessel fall and rise
oh, it did not need a prophet to tell what the end must be
for no ship could ride in safety near that shore on such a sea

then the pitying people hurried from their homes and thronged the beach
oh, for power to cross the waters and the perishing to reach
helpless hands were wrung in terror, tender hearts grew cold with dread
and the ship, urged by the tempest, to the fatal rock-shore sped

lo! when next the white, shocked faces looked with terror on the sea
only one last clinging figure on a spar was seen to be

nearer to the trembling watchers came the wreck tossed by the wave
and the man still clung and floated, though no power on earth could save

any memory of his sermon? firstly? secondly? ah, no
there was but one thing to utter in that awful hour of woe
so he shouted through the trumpet, "look to jesus
can you hear?" and "aye, aye, sir," rang the answer o'er the waters loud
and clear

then they listened,--"he is singing, 'jesus, lover of my soul
and the winds brought back the echo, "while the nearer waters roll
strange, indeed, it was to hear him,--"till the storm of life is past
singing bravely o'er the waters, "oh, receive my soul at last

he could have no other refuge,--"hangs my helpless soul on thee
and the watchers, looking homeward, through their eyes by tears made dim
said, "he passed to be with jesus in the singing of that hymn



though to walk near its crest was so pleasant
but over its terrible edge there had slipped
a duke and full many a peasant
so the people said something would have to be done
but their projects did not at all tally
some said, "put a fence around the edge of the cliff
some, "an ambulance down in the valley

but the cry for the ambulance carried the day
for it spread through the neighboring city
a fence may be useful or not, it is true
but each heart became brimful of pity
for those who slipped over that dangerous cliff
and the dwellers in highway and alley
gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence
but an ambulance down in the valley

it isn't the slipping that hurts them so much
as the shock down below when they're stopping
so day after day, as these mishaps occurred
quick forth would these rescuers sally
to pick up the victims who fell off the cliff
with their ambulance down in the valley

then an old sage remarked: "it's a marvel to me
that people give far more attention
to repairing results than to stopping the cause
when they'd much better aim at prevention
let us stop at its source all this mischief," cried he
if the cliff we will fence, we might almost dispense
with the ambulance down in the valley

he'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could
no! no! we'll support them forever
aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall
and shall this man dictate to us? shall he
why should people of sense stop to put up a fence
while the ambulance works in the valley

but a sensible few, who are practical too
will not bear with such nonsense much longer
they believe that prevention is better than cure
and their party will soon be the stronger
encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen
and while other philanthropists dally
they will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence
on the cliff that hangs over the valley

better guide well the young than reclaim them when old
for the voice of true wisdom is calling
to prevent other people from falling
better close up the source of temptation and crime
than deliver from dungeon or galley
better put a strong fence 'round the top of the cliff
than an ambulance down in the valley



a district school, not far away
was humming with its wonted noise
of three-score mingled girls and boys
some few upon their tasks intent
but more on furtive mischief bent
the while the master's downward look
was fastened on a copy-book
when suddenly, behind his back
rose sharp and clear a rousing smack
as 'twere a battery of bliss
let off in one tremendous kiss
i thaw him kith thuthanna peathe
with frown to make a statue thrill
the master thundered, "hither, will
like wretch o'ertaken in his track
with stolen chattels on his back
will hung his head in fear and shame
and to the awful presence came
a great, green, bashful simpleton
the butt of all good-natured fun
with smile suppressed, and birch upraised
the threatener faltered, "i'm amazed
that you, my biggest pupil, should
be guilty of an act so rude
before the whole set school to boot
what evil genius put you to 't
but when susanna shook her curls
and whispered i was 'fraid of girls
and dursn't kiss a baby's doll
i couldn't stand it, sir, at all
but up and kissed her on the spot
i know--boo-hoo--i ought to not
but, somehow, from her looks--boo-hoo
i thought she kind o' wished me to



do you know you have asked for the costliest thing
ever made by the hand above
a woman's heart and a woman's life
and a woman's wonderful love

do you know you have asked for this priceless thing
as a child might ask for a toy
demanding what others have died to win
with the reckless dash of a boy

you have written my lesson of duty out
man-like you have questioned me
now stand at the bar of my woman's soul
until i shall question thee

you require your mutton shall always be hot
your socks and your shirts shall be whole
i require your heart to be true as god's stars
and pure as heaven your soul

you require a cook for your mutton and beef
i require a far better thing
a seamstress you're wanting for stockings and shirts
i look for a man and a king

a king for a beautiful realm called home
and a man that the maker, god
shall look upon as he did the first
and say, "it is very good

i am fair and young, but the rose will fade
from my soft, young cheek one day
will you love then, 'mid the falling leaves
as you did 'mid the bloom of may

is your heart an ocean so strong and deep
i may launch my all on its tide
a loving woman finds heaven or hell
on the day she is made a bride

i require all things that are grand and true
all things that a man should be
if you give this all, i would stake my life
to be all you demand of me

if you cannot do this, a laundress and cook
you can hire with little to pay
but a woman's heart and a woman's life
are not to be won that way



i want free life and i want fresh air
and i sigh for the canter after the cattle
the crack of the whips like shots in battle
the mellay of horns, and hoofs, and heads
that wars, and wrangles, and scatters, and spreads
the green beneath and the blue above
and dash and danger, and life and love
and lasca
lasca used to ride
on a mouse-gray mustang, close to my side
with blue _serape_ and bright-belled spur
i laughed with joy as i looked at her
little knew she of books or creeds
an _ave maria_ sufficed her needs
little she cared, save to be by my side
to ride with me, and ever to ride
from san saba's shore to lavaca's tide
she was as bold as the billows that beat
she was as wild as the breezes that blow
from her little head to her little feet
she was swayed, in her suppleness, to and fro
by each gust of passion; a sapling pine
that grows on the edge of a kansas bluff
and wars with the wind when the weather is rough
is like this lasca, this love of mine
she would hunger that i might eat
would take the bitter and leave me the sweet
but once, when i made her jealous for fun
at something i'd whispered, or looked, or done
one sunday, in san antonio
to a glorious girl on the alamo
she drew from her girdle a dear little dagger
and--sting of a wasp!--it made me stagger
an inch to the left or an inch to the right
and i shouldn't be maundering here to-night
but she sobbed, and, sobbing, so swiftly bound
her torn _rebosa_ about the wound
that i quite forgave her. scratches don't count
in texas, down by the rio grande

her eye was brown,--a deep, deep brown
her hair was darker than her eye
and something in her smile and frown
curled crimson lip, and instep high
showed that there ran in each blue vein
mixed with the milder aztec strain
the vigorous vintage of old spain
she was alive in every limb
with feeling, to the finger tips
and when the sun is like a fire
and sky one shining, soft sapphire
one does not drink in little sips

the air was heavy, the night was hot
i sat by her side, and forgot--forgot
forgot the herd that were taking their rest
forgot that the air was close opprest
that the texas norther comes sudden and soon
in the dead of night or the blaze of noon
that once let the herd at its breath take fright
that nothing on earth can stop the flight
and woe to the rider, and woe to the steed
who falls in front of their mad stampede
was that thunder? no, by the lord
i sprang to my saddle without a word
one foot on mine, and she clung behind
away on a hot chase down the wind
but never was fox-hunt half so hard
and never was steed so little spared
for we rode for our lives. you shall hear how we fared
in texas, down by the rio grande

the mustang flew, and we urged him on
there was one chance left, and you have but one
halt, jump to the ground, and shoot your horse
crouch under his carcass, and take your chance
and if the steers, in their frantic course
don't batter you both to pieces at once
you may thank your star; if not, good-by
to the quickening kiss and the long-drawn sigh
and the open air and the open sky
in texas, down by the rio grande

the cattle gained on us, and just as i felt
for my old six-shooter, behind in my belt
down came the mustang, and down came we
clinging together, and--what was the rest
a body that spread itself on my breast
two arms that shielded my dizzy head
two lips that hard on my lips were pressed
then came thunder in my ears
as over us surged the sea of steers
blows that beat blood into my eyes
and when i could rise
lasca was dead

i gouged out a grave a few feet deep
and there in earth's arms i laid her to sleep
and there she is lying, and no one knows
and the summer shines and the winter snows
for many a day the flowers have spread
a pall of petals over her head
and the little gray hawk hangs aloft in the air
and the sly coyote trots here and there
and the black snake glides, and glitters, and slides
into the rift in a cotton-wood tree
and the buzzard sails on
and comes and is gone
stately and still like a ship at sea
and i wonder why i do not care
for the things that are like the things that were
does half my heart lie buried there
in texas, down by the rio grande



over the hill to the poor-house i'm trudgin' my weary way
i, a woman of seventy, and only a trifle gray
i, who am smart an' chipper, for all the years i've told
as many another woman that's only half as old

over the hill to the poor-house--i can't quite make it clear
over the hill to the poor-house-it seems so horrid queer
many a step i've taken a-toiling to and fro
but this is a sort of journey i never thought to go

what is the use of heapin' on me a pauper's shame
am i lazy or crazy? am i blind or lame
true, i am not so supple, nor yet so awful stout
but charity ain't no favor, if one can live without

i am willin' and anxious an' ready any day
to work for a decent livin', an' pay my honest way
for i can earn my victuals, an' more too, i'll be bound
if anybody only is willin' to have me round

once i was young an' han'some--i was upon my soul
once my cheeks was roses, my eyes as black as coal
and i can't remember, in them days, of hearin' people say
for any kind of a reason, that i was in their way

but many a house an' home was open then to me
many a han'some offer i had from likely men
and nobody ever hinted that i was a burden then

and when to john i was married, sure he was good and smart
but he and all the neighbors would own i done my part
for life was all before me, an' i was young an' strong
and i worked the best that i could in tryin' to get along

and so we worked together: and life was hard, but gay
with now and then a baby for to cheer us on our way
till we had half a dozen, an' all growed clean an' neat
an' went to school like others, an' had enough to eat

so we worked for the childr'n, and raised 'em every one
worked for 'em summer and winter just as we ought to've done
only, perhaps, we humored 'em, which some good folks condemn
but every couple's childr'n's a heap the best to them

strange how much we think of our blessed little ones
i'd have died for my daughters, i'd have died for my sons
and god he made that rule of love; but when we're old and gray
i've noticed it sometimes, somehow, fails to work the other way

strange, another thing: when our boys an' girls was grown
and when, exceptin' charley, they'd left us there alone
when john he nearer an' nearer come, an' dearer seemed to be
the lord of hosts he come one day, an' took him away from me

still i was bound to struggle, an' never to cringe or fall
still i worked for charley, for charley was now my all
and charley was pretty good to me, with scarce a word or frown
till at last he went a-courtin', and brought a wife from town

she was somewhat dressy, an' hadn't a pleasant smile
she was quite conceity, and carried a heap o' style
but if ever i tried to be friends, i did with her, i know
but she was hard and proud, an' i couldn't make it go

she had an edication, an' that was good for her
but when she twitted me on mine, 'twas carryin' things too fur
an' i told her once, 'fore company (an' it almost made her sick
that i never swallowed a grammar, or eat a 'rithmetic

so 'twas only a few days before the thing was done
they was a family of themselves, and i another one
and a very little cottage one family will do
but i never have seen a house that was big enough for two

an' i never could speak to suit her, never could please her eye
an' it made me independent, an' then i didn't try
but i was terribly staggered, an' felt it like a blow
when charley turn'd agin me, an' told me i could go

i went to live with susan, but susan's house was small
and she was always a-hintin' how snug it was for us all
and what with her husband's sisters, and what with childr'n three

an' then i went to thomas, the oldest son i've got
for thomas's buildings'd cover the half of an acre lot
but all the childr'n was on me--i couldn't stand their sauce
and thomas said i needn't think i was comin' there to boss

an' then i wrote rebecca, my girl who lives out west
and to isaac, not far from her--some twenty miles, at best
and one of 'em said 'twas too warm there for any one so old
and t'other had an opinion the climate was too cold

so they have shirked and slighted me, an' shifted me about
so they have well-nigh soured me, an' wore my old heart out
but still i've borne up pretty well, an' wasn't much put down
till charley went to the poor-master, an' put me on the town

over the hill to the poor-house--my childr'n dear, good-by
many a night i've watched you when only god was nigh
and god'll judge between us; but i will always pray
that you shall never suffer the half i do to-day



when freedom from her mountain height
unfurled her standard to the air
she tore the azure robe of night
and set the stars of glory there
she mingled with its gorgeous dyes
the milky baldric of the skies
and striped its pure celestial white
with streakings of the morning light
then from his mansion in the sun
she called her eagle bearer down
and gave into his mighty hand
the symbol of her chosen land

majestic monarch of the cloud
who rear'st aloft thy regal form
to hear the tempest trumpings loud
and see the lightning lances driven
when strive the warriors of the storm
and rolls the thunder-drum of heaven
child of the sun! to thee 'tis given
to guard the banner of the free
to hover in the sulphur smoke
to ward away the battle stroke
and bid its blendings shine afar
like rainbows on the cloud of war
the harbingers of victory

flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly
the sign of hope and triumph high
when speaks the signal trumpet tone
and the long line comes gleaming on
ere yet the lifeblood, warm and wet
has dimmed the glistening bayonet
each soldier eye shall brightly turn
to where thy sky-born glories burn
and, as his springing steps advance
catch war and vengeance from the glance

and when the cannon-mouthings loud
heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud
and gory sabres rise and fall
like shoots of flame on midnight's pall
then shall thy meteor glances glow
and cowering foes shall shrink beneath
each gallant arm that strikes below
that lovely messenger of death

flag of the seas! on ocean wave
thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave
when death, careering on the gale
sweeps darkly 'round the bellied sail
and frighted waves rush wildly back
before the broadside's reeling rack
each dying wanderer of the sea
shall look at once to heaven and thee
and smile to see thy splendors fly
in triumph o'er his closing eye

flag of the free heart's hope and home
by angel hands to valor given
thy stars have lit the welkin dome
and all thy hues were born in heaven
forever float that standard sheet
where breathes the foe but falls before us
with freedom's soil beneath our feet
and freedom's banner streaming o'er us



a bunch of golden keys is mine
to make each day with gladness shine

that unlocks every door for me

when evening comes, "good night!" i say
and close the door of each glad day

when at the table "if you please
i take from off my bunch of keys

when friends give anything to me
i'll use the little "thank you" key

when by mistake some harm i do

or if unkindly harm i've given
with "forgive me" key i'll be forgiven

on a golden ring these keys i'll bind
this is its motto: "be ye kind

i'll often use each golden key
and so a happy child i'll be


i know a place where the sun is like gold
and the cherry blooms burst like snow
and down underneath is the loveliest nook
where the four-leaf clovers grow

one leaf is for faith, and one is for hope
and one is for love, you know
and god put another one in for luck
if you search, you will find where they grow

but you must have faith and you must have hope
you must love and be strong, and so
if you work, if you wait, you will find the place
where the four-leaf clovers grow



note: a remarkable custom, brought from the old country, formerly
prevailed in the rural districts of new england. on the death of a
member of the family, the bees were at once informed of the event, and
their hives dressed in mourning. this ceremonial was supposed to be
necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a
new home

here is the place; right over the hill
runs the path i took
you can see the gap in the old wall still
and the stepping-stones in the shallow brook

there is the house, with the gate red-barred
and the poplars tall
and the barn's brown length, and the cattle-yard
and the white horns tossing above the wall

there are the beehives ranged in the sun
and down by the brink
of the brook are her poor flowers, weed-o'errun
pansy and daffodil, rose and pink

a year has gone, as the tortoise goes
heavy and slow
and the same rose blows, and the same sun glows
and the same brook sings of a year ago

there's the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze
and the june sun warm
tangles his wings of fire in the trees
setting, as then, over fernside farm

i mind me how with a lover's care
from my sunday coat
i brushed off the burs, and smoothed my hair
and cooled at the brookside my brow and throat

since we parted, a month had passed
to love, a year
down through the beeches i looked at last
on the little red gate and the well-sweep near

i can see it all now,--the slantwise rain
of light through the leaves
the sundown's blaze on her window-pane
the bloom of her roses under the eaves

just the same as a month before
the house and the trees
the barn's brown gable, the vine by the door
nothing changed but the hives of bees

before them, under the garden wall
forward and back
went drearily singing the chore-girl small
draping each hive with a shred of black

trembling, i listened; the summer sun
had the chill of snow
for i knew she was telling the bees of one
gone on the journey we all must go

then i said to myself, "my mary weeps
for the dead to-day
haply her blind grandsire sleeps
the fret and pain of his age away

but her dog whined low; on the doorway sill
with his cane to his chin
the old man sat; and the chore-girl still
sung to the bees stealing out and in

and the song she was singing ever since
in my ear sounds on
mistress mary is dead and gone



not understood, we move along asunder
our paths grow wider as the seasons creep
along the years. we marvel and we wonder
why life is life, and then we fall asleep
not understood

not understood, we gather false impressions
and hug them closer as the years go by
till virtues often seem to us transgressions
and thus men rise and fall and live and die
not understood

not understood, poor souls with stunted visions
often measure giants by their narrow gauge
the poisoned shafts of falsehood and derision
are oft impelled 'gainst those who mould the age
not understood

not understood, the secret springs of action
which lie beneath the surface and the show
are disregarded; with self-satisfaction
we judge our neighbors, and they often go
not understood

not understood, how trifles often change us
the thoughtless sentence or the fancied slight
destroy long years of friendship and estrange us
and on our souls there falls a freezing blight
not understood

not understood, how many hearts are aching
for lack of sympathy! ah! day by day
how many cheerless, lonely hearts are breaking
how many noble spirits pass away
not understood

o god! that men would see a little clearer
or judge less hardly when they cannot see
o god! that men would draw a little nearer
to one another! they'd be nearer thee
and understood


the woman was old, and ragged, and gray
and bent with the chill of a winter's day
the streets were white with a recent snow
and the woman's feet with age were slow

at the crowded crossing she waited long
jostled aside by the careless throng
of human beings who passed her by
unheeding the glance of her anxious eye

down the street with laughter and shout
glad in the freedom of "school let out
come happy boys, like a flock of sheep
hailing the snow piled white and deep
past the woman, so old and gray
hastened the children on their way

none offered a helping hand to her
so weak and timid, afraid to stir
lest the carriage wheels or the horses' feet
should trample her down in the slippery street

at last came out of the merry troop
the gayest boy of all the group
he paused beside her, and whispered low

her aged hand on his strong young arm
she placed, and so without hurt or harm
he guided the trembling feet along
proud that his own were young and strong
then back again to his friends he went
his young heart happy and well content

for all she's aged, and poor, and slow
and some one, some time, may lend a hand
to help my mother--you understand
if ever she's poor, and old, and gray
and her own dear boy is far away

in her home that 'night, and the prayer she said
was: "god, be kind to that noble boy
who is somebody's son, and pride and joy

faint was the voice, and worn and weak
but the father hears when his children speak
angels caught the faltering word
and "somebody's mother's" prayer was heard


whither, midst falling dew
while glow the heavens with the last steps of day
far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue
thy solitary way

vainly the fowler's eye
might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong
as, darkly seen against the crimson sky
thy figure floats along

seek'st thou the plashy brink
of weedy lake, or marge of river wide
or where the rocking billows rise and sink
on the chafed ocean-side

there is a power whose care
teaches thy way along that pathless coast
the desert and illimitable air
lone wandering, but not lost

all day thy wings have fanned
at that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere
yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land
though the dark night is near

and soon that toil shall end
soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest
and scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend
soon, o'er thy sheltered nest

thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven
hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart
deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given
and shall not soon depart

he who, from zone to zone
guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight
in the long way that i must tread alone
will lead my steps aright



who fed me from her gentle breast
and hushed me in her arms to rest
and on my cheek sweet kisses prest
my mother

when sleep forsook my open eye
who was it sung sweet lullaby
and rocked me that i should not cry
my mother

who sat and watched my infant head
when sleeping in my cradle bed
and tears of sweet affection shed
my mother

when pain and sickness made me cry
who gazed upon my heavy eye
and wept, for fear that i should die
my mother

who ran to help me when i fell
and would some pretty story tell
or kiss the part to make it well
my mother

who taught my infant lips to pray
to love god's holy word and day
and walk in wisdom's pleasant way
my mother

and can i ever cease to be
affectionate and kind to thee
who wast so very kind to me
my mother

oh, no, the thought i cannot bear
and if god please my life to spare
i hope i shall reward thy care
my mother

when thou art feeble, old and gray
my healthy arms shall be thy stay
and i will soothe thy pains away
my mother

and when i see thee hang thy head
and tears of sweet affection shed
my mother


the sun was shining on the sea
shining with all his might
he did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright
and this was odd, because it was
the middle of the night

the moon was shining sulkily
because she thought the sun
had got no business to be there
after the day was done

the sea was wet as wet could be
the sands were dry as dry
you could not see a cloud, because
no cloud was in the sky
no birds were flying overhead
there were no birds to fly

the walrus and the carpenter
were walking close at hand
they wept like anything to see
such quantities of sand
they said, "it would be grand

swept it for half a year
do you suppose," the walrus said
and shed a bitter tear

the walrus did beseech
along the briny beach
we cannot do with more than four
to give a hand to each

the eldest oyster looked at him
but never a word he said
the eldest oyster winked his eye
and shook his heavy head
meaning to say he did not choose
to leave the oyster-bed

but four young oysters hurried up
all eager for the treat
their coats were brushed, their faces washed
their shoes were clean and neat
and this was odd, because, you know
they hadn't any feet

four other oysters followed them
and yet another four
and thick and fast they came at last
and more, and more, and more
all hopping through the frothy waves
and scrambling to the shore

the walrus and the carpenter
walked on a mile or so
and then they rested on a rock
conveniently low
and all the little oysters stood
and waited in a row

of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax
of cabbages and kings
and why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings

for some of us are out of breath
and all of us are fat
they thanked him much for that

pepper and vinegar besides
are very good indeed
now, if you're ready, oysters dear
we can begin to feed

turning a little blue
a dismal thing to do

and you are very nice
the carpenter said nothing but
i wish you were not quite so deaf
i've had to ask you twice

after we've brought them out so far
and made them trot so quick
the carpenter said nothing but

with sobs and tears he sorted out
those of the largest size
holding his pocket-handkerchief
before his streaming eyes

shall we be trotting home again
but answer came there none
and this was scarcely odd, because
they'd eaten every one



the weary teacher sat alone
while twilight gathered on
and not a sound was heard around
the boys and girls were gone

the weary teacher sat alone
unnerved and pale was he
bowed 'neath a yoke of care, he spoke
in sad soliloquy

of labor thrown away
another chain of toil and pain
dragged through a tedious day

love's sacrifice is lost
the hopes of morn, so golden, turn
each evening, into dross

my strength, my life, my all
the seeds i sow will never grow
they perish where they fall

he sighed, and low upon his hands
his aching brow he pressed
and o'er his frame ere long there came
a soothing sense of rest

and then he lifted up his face
but started back aghast
the room, by strange and sudden change
assumed proportions vast

it seemed a senate-hall, and one
addressed a listening throng
each burning word all bosoms stirred
applause rose loud and long

the 'wildered teacher thought he knew
the speaker's voice and look
is in my record book

the stately senate-hall dissolved
a church rose in its place
wherein there stood a man of god
dispensing words of grace

and though he spoke in solemn tone
and though his hair was gray
the teacher's thought was strangely wrought

the church, a phantom, vanished soon
what saw the teacher then
in classic gloom of alcoved room
an author plied his pen

filled with a new surprise
among the great and wise

the vision of a cottage home
the teacher now descried
a mother's face illumed the place
her influence sanctified

this matron, well i know
was but a wild and careless child
not half an hour ago

of duty's golden rule
her lips repeat in accents sweet
my words to her at school

the scene was changed again, and lo
the schoolhouse rude and old
upon the wall did darkness fall
the evening air was cold

then paced along the floor
and, whistling slow and soft and low
he locked the schoolhouse door

and, walking home, his heart was full
of peace and trust and praise
and singing slow and soft and low
said, "after many days



girt round with rugged mountains, the fair lake constance lies
in her blue heart reflected shine back the starry skies
and watching each white cloudlet float silently and slow
you think a piece of heaven lies on our earth below

midnight is there: and silence, enthroned in heaven, looks down
upon her own calm mirror, upon a sleeping town
for bregenz, that quaint city upon the tyrol shore
has stood above lake constance a thousand years and more

her battlement and towers, from off their rocky steep
have cast their trembling shadow for ages on the deep
mountain, and lake, and valley, a sacred legend know
of how the town was saved, one night three hundred years ago

far from her home and kindred, a tyrol maid had fled
to serve in the swiss valleys, and toil for daily bread
and every year that fleeted so silently and fast
seemed to bear farther from her the memory of the past

she served kind, gentle masters, nor asked for rest or change
her friends seemed no more new ones, their speech seemed no more strange
and when she led her cattle to pasture every day
she ceased to look and wonder on which side bregenz lay

she spoke no more of bregenz, with longing and with tears
her tyrol home seemed faded in a deep mist of years
she heeded not the rumors of austrian war and strife
each day she rose, contented, to the calm toils of life

yet when her master's children would clustering round her stand
she sang them ancient ballads of her own native land
and when at morn and evening she knelt before god's throne
the accents of her childhood rose to her lips alone

and so she dwelt: the valley more peaceful year by year
when suddenly strange portents of some great deed seemed near
the golden corn was bending upon its fragile stock
while farmers, heedless of their fields, paced up and down in talk

the men seemed stern and altered, with looks cast on the ground
with anxious faces, one by one, the women gathered round
all talk of flax, or spinning, or work, was put away
the very children seemed afraid to go alone to play

one day, out in the meadow with strangers from the town
some secret plan discussing, the men walked up and down
yet now and then seemed watching a strange uncertain, gleam
that looked like lances 'mid the trees that stood below the stream

at eve they all assembled, then care and doubt were fled
with jovial laugh they feasted; the board was nobly spread
the elder of the village rose up, his glass in hand
and cried, "we drink the downfall of an accursed land

bregenz, our foeman's stronghold, bregenz shall be our own
the women shrank in terror, (yet pride, too, had her part
but one poor tyrol maiden felt death within her heart

before her stood fair bregenz, once more her towers arose
what were the friends beside her? only her country's foes
the faces of her kinsfolk, the days of childhood flown
the echoes of her mountains, reclaimed her as their own

nothing she heard around her, (though shouts rang forth again
gone were the green swiss valleys, the pasture, and the plain
before her eyes one vision, and in her heart one cry
that said, "go forth, save bregenz, and then, if need be, die

with trembling haste and breathless, with noiseless step, she sped
horses and weary cattle were standing in the shed
she loosed the strong white charger, that fed from out her hand
she mounted, and she turned his head towards her native land

out--out into the darkness--faster, and still more fast
the smooth grass flies behind her, the chestnut wood is past
she looks up; clouds are heavy: why is her steed so slow
scarcely the wind beside them can pass them as they go

but louder than bells' ringing, or lowing of the kine
grows nearer in the midnight the rushing of the rhine

shall not the roaring waters their headlong gallop check
the steed draws back in terror, she leans upon his neck
to watch the flowing darkness,--the bank is high and steep
one pause--he staggers forward, and plunges in the deep

she strives to pierce the blackness, and looser throws the rein
her steed must breast the waters that dash above his mane
how gallantly, how nobly, he struggles through the foam
and see--in the far distance shine out the lights of home

up the steep bank he bears her, and now they rush again
toward the heights of bregenz, that tower above the plain
they reach the gate of bregenz, just as the midnight rings
and out come serf and soldier to meet the news she brings

bregenz is saved! ere daylight her battlements are manned
defiance greets the army that marches on the land
and if to deeds heroic should endless fame be paid
bregenz does well to honor the noble tyrol maid

three hundred years are vanished, and yet upon the hill
an old stone gateway rises, to do her honor still
and there, when bregenz women sit spinning in the shade
they see in quaint old carving the charger and the maid

and when, to guard old bregenz, by gateway, street, and tower
the warder paces all night long, and calls each passing hour
when midnight pauses in the skies he calls the maiden's name



better than grandeur, better than gold
than rank and title a thousand fold
is a healthy body, a mind at ease
and simple pleasures that always please
a heart that can feel for a neighbor's woe
and share his joys with a genial glow
with sympathies large enough to enfold
all men as brothers,--is better than gold

better than gold is a conscience clear
though toiling for bread in an humble sphere
doubly blest with content and health
untried by the lusts or cares of wealth
lowly living and lofty thought
adorn and ennoble a poor man's cot
for mind and morals, in nature's plan
are the genuine test of a gentleman

better than gold is the sweet repose
of the sons of toil when their labors close
better than gold is the poor man's sleep
and the balm that drops on his slumbers deep
bring sleeping draughts to the downy bed
where luxury pillows his aching head
his simple opiate labor deems
a shorter road to the land of dreams

better than gold is a thinking mind
that in the realm of books can find
a treasure surpassing australian ore
and live with the great and good of yore
the sage's lore and the poet's lay
the glories of empires pass'd away
the world's great drama will thus unfold
and yield a pleasure better than gold

better than gold is a peaceful home
where all the fireside charities come
the shrine of love and the heaven of life
hallowed by mother, or sister, or wife
however humble the home may be
or tried with sorrow by heaven's decree
the blessings that never were bought or sold
and center there, are better than gold



o suns and skies and clouds of june
and flowers of june together
ye cannot rival for one hour
october's bright blue weather

when loud the bumblebee makes haste
belated, thriftless vagrant
and goldenrod is dying fast
and lanes with grapes are fragrant

when gentians roll their fringes tight
to save them for the morning
and chestnuts fall from satin burrs
without a sound of warning

when on the ground red apples lie
in piles like jewels shining
and redder still on old stone walls
are leaves of woodbine twining

when all the lovely wayside things
their white-winged seeds are sowing
and in the fields, still green and fair
late aftermaths are growing

when springs run low, and on the brooks
in idle, golden freighting
bright leaves sink noiseless in the hush
of woods, for winter waiting

when comrades seek sweet country haunts
by twos and threes together
and count like misers hour by hour
october's bright blue weather

o suns and skies and flowers of june
count all your boasts together
love loveth best of all the year
october's bright blue weather



said brier-rose's mother to the naughty brier-rose
you will not scrub the kettles, and you will not touch the broom
you never sit a minute still at spinning-wheel or loom

thus grumbled in the morning, and grumbled late at eve
the good-wife as she bustled with pot and tray and sieve
but brier-rose, she laughed and she cocked her dainty head

to marry such a worthless wench, these seven leagues around
but brier-rose, she laughed and she trilled a merry lay

the good-wife with a "humph" and a sigh forsook the battle
and flung her pots and pails about with much vindictive rattle
that thou hast punished me in age with such a wayward child

up stole the girl on tiptoe, so that none her step could hear
and laughing pressed an airy kiss behind the good-wife's ear
and she, as e'er relenting, sighed: "oh, heaven only knows
whatever will become of you, my naughty brier-rose

the sun was high and summer sounds were teeming in the air
the clank of scythes, the cricket's whir, and swelling woodnotes rare
from fields and copse and meadow; and through the open door
sweet, fragrant whiffs of new-mown hay the idle breezes bore

then brier-rose grew pensive, like a bird of thoughtful mien
whose little life has problems among the branches green
she heard the river brawling where the tide was swift and strong
she heard the summer singing its strange, alluring song

and out she skipped the meadows o'er and gazed into the sky
her heart o'erbrimmed with gladness, she scarce herself knew why
and to a merry tune she hummed, "oh, heaven only knows
whatever will become of the naughty brier-rose

whene'er a thrifty matron this idle maid espied
she shook her head in warning, and scarce her wrath could hide
for girls were made for housewives, for spinning-wheel and loom
and not to drink the sunshine and wild flower's sweet perfume

and oft the maidens cried, when the brier-rose went by
but brier-rose, as was her wont, she cocked her curly head

and oft the young lads shouted, when they saw the maid at play
then she shook her tiny fist; to her cheeks the color flew

till she was twenty summers old and yet remained unwed
and all the parish wondered: "the lord almighty knows
whatever will become of that naughty brier-rose

and while they wondered came the spring a-dancing o'er the hills
her breath was warmer than of yore, and all the mountain rills
with their tinkling and their rippling and their rushing, filled the air
and the misty sounds of water forth-welling everywhere

and in the valley's depth, like a lusty beast of prey
the river leaped and roared aloud and tossed its mane of spray
then hushed again its voice to a softly plashing croon
as dark it rolled beneath the sun and white beneath the moon

it was a merry sight to see the lumber as it whirled
adown the tawny eddies that hissed and seethed and swirled
now shooting through the rapids and, with a reeling swing
into the foam-crests diving like an animated thing

but in the narrows of the rocks, where o'er a steep incline
the waters plunged, and wreathed in foam the dark boughs of the pine
the lads kept watch with shout and song, and sent each straggling beam
a-spinning down the rapids, lest it should lock the stream

a rush of feet, a dog's harsh bark, a torch's flaring light
and wandering gusts of dampness, and round us far and nigh
a throbbing boom of water like a pulse-beat in the sky

the dawn just pierced the pallid east with spears of gold and red
as we, with boat-hooks in our hands, toward the narrows sped
and terror smote us; for we heard the mighty tree-tops sway
and thunder, as of chariots, and hissing showers of spray

a hundred crowns i give to him who breaks the lumber lock
for if another hour go by, the angry waters' spoil
our homes will be, and fields, and our weary years of toil

we looked each at the other; each hoped his neighbor would
brave death and danger for his home, as valiant norsemen should
but at our feet the brawling tide expanded like a lake
and whirling beams came shooting on, and made the firm rock quake

but not a man came forward, and no one spoke or stirred
and nothing save the thunder of the cataract was heard

but as with trembling hands and with fainting hearts we stood
we spied a little curly head emerging from the wood
we heard a little snatch of a merry little song
and saw the dainty brier-rose come dancing through the throng

an angry murmur rose from the people round about
why ever he created that worthless brier-rose

sweet brier-rose, she heard their cries; a little pensive smile
across her fair face flitted that might a stone beguile
and then she gave her pretty head a roguish little cock

derisive shouts of laughter broke from throats of young and old
and, mockingly, a boat-hook into her hands was flung
when, lo! into the river's midst with daring leaps she sprung

we saw her dimly through a mist of dense and blinding spray
from beam to beam she skipped, like a water-sprite at play
and now and then faint gleams we caught of color through the mist
a crimson waist, a golden head, a little dainty wrist

in terror pressed the people to the margin of the hill
a hundred breaths were bated, a hundred hearts stood still
for, hark! from out the rapids came a strange and creaking sound
and then a crash of thunder which shook the very ground

the waters hurled the lumber mass down o'er the rocky steep
we heard a muffled rumbling and a rolling in the deep
we saw a tiny form which the torrent swiftly bore
and flung into the wild abyss, where it was seen no more

ah, little naughty brier-rose, thou couldst not weave nor spin
yet thou couldst do a nobler deed than all thy mocking kin
for thou hadst courage e'en to die, and by thy death to save
a thousand farms and lives from the fury of the wave

and yet the adage lives, in the valley of thy birth
when wayward children spend their days in heedless play and mirth
oft mothers say, half smiling, half sighing, "heaven knows
whatever will become of the naughty brier-rose



robert of sicily, brother of pope urbane
and valmond, emperor of allemaine
appareled in magnificent attire
with retinue of many a knight and squire
on st. john's eve, at vespers, proudly sat
and heard the priests chant the magnificat
and as he listened, o'er and o'er again
repeated, like a burden or refrain
he caught the words, _"deposuit potentes
de sede, et exaltavit humiles
and slowly lifting up his kingly head
he to a learned clerk beside him said
and has exalted them of low degree
thereat king robert muttered scornfully
only by priests, and in the latin tongue
for unto priests, and people be it known
there is no power can push me from my throne
and leaning back he yawned and fell asleep
lulled by the chant monotonous and deep

when he awoke, it was already night
the church was empty, and there was no light
save where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint
lighted a little space before some saint
he started from his seat and gazed around
but saw no living thing and heard no sound
he groped towards the door, but it was locked
he cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked
and uttered awful threatenings and complaints
and imprecations upon men and saints
the sounds re-echoed from the roof and walls
as if dead priests were laughing in their stalls

at length the sexton, hearing from without
the tumult of the knocking and the shout
and thinking thieves were in the house of prayer
came with his lantern, asking "who is there
half choked with rage, king robert fiercely said
the frightened sexton, muttering with a curse
turned the great key and flung the portal wide
a man rushed by him at a single stride
haggard, half-naked, without hat or cloak
who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke
but leaped into the blackness of the night
and vanished like a spectre from his sight

robert of sicily, brother of pope urbane
and valmond, emperor of allemaine
despoiled of his magnificent attire
bare-headed, breathless, and besprent with mire
with sense of wrong and outrage desperate
strode on and thundered at the palace gate
rushed through the court-yard, thrusting in his rage
to right and left each seneschal and page
and hurried up the broad and sounding stair
his white face ghastly in the torches' glare
from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed
voices and cries he heard, but did not heed
until at last he reached the banquet-room
blazing with light, and breathing with perfume

there on the dais sat another king
wearing his robes, his crown, his signet ring
king robert's self in features, form, and height
but all transfigured with angelic light
it was an angel; and his presence there
with a divine effulgence filled the air
an exaltation, piercing the disguise
though none the hidden angel recognize

a moment speechless, motionless, amazed
the throneless monarch on the angel gazed
who met his look of anger and surprise
with the divine compassion of his eyes
then said, "who art thou, and why com'st thou here
to which king robert answered with a sneer
from an impostor, who usurps my throne
and suddenly, at these audacious words
up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords
the angel answered with unruffled brow
henceforth shalt wear the bells and scalloped cape
and for thy counselor shalt lead an ape
thou shalt obey my servants when they call
and wait upon my henchmen in the hall

deaf to king robert's threats and cries and prayers
they thrust him from the hall and down the stairs
a group of tittering pages ran before
and as they opened wide the folding door
his heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms
the boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms
and all the vaulted chamber roar and ring
with the mock plaudits of "long live the king

next morning, waking with the day's first beam
he said within himself, "it was a dream
but the straw rustled as he turned his head
there were the cap and bells beside his bed
around him rose the bare, discolored walls
close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls
and in the corner, a revolting shape
shivering and chattering, sat the wretched ape
it was no dream; the world he loved so much
had turned to dust and ashes at his touch

days came and went; and now returned again
to sicily the old saturnian reign
under the angel's governance benign
the happy island danced with corn and wine
and deep within the mountain's burning breast
enceladus, the giant, was at rest

meanwhile king robert yielded to his fate
sullen and silent and disconsolate
dressed in the motley garb that jesters wear
with look bewildered, and a vacant stare
close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn
by courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn
his only friend the ape, his only food
what others left--he still was unsubdued
and when the angel met him on his way
and half in earnest, half in jest, would say
sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel
the velvet scabbard held a sword of steel
burst from him in resistless overflow
and lifting high his forehead, he would fling
the haughty answer back, "i am, i am the king

almost three years were ended, when there came
ambassadors of great repute and name
from valmond, emperor of allemaine
unto king robert, saying that pope urbane
by letter summoned them forthwith to come
on holy thursday to his city of rome
the angel with great joy received his guests
and gave them presents of embroidered vests
and velvet mantles with rich ermine lined
and rings and jewels of the rarest kind
then he departed with them o'er the sea
into the lovely land of italy
whose loveliness was more resplendent made
by the mere passing of that cavalcade
with plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir
of jeweled bridle and of golden spur

and lo! among the menials, in mock state
upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait
his cloak of foxtails flapping in the wind
the solemn ape demurely perched behind
king robert rode, making huge merriment
in all the country towns through which they went

the pope received them with great pomp, and blare
of bannered trumpets, on st. peter's square
giving his benediction and embrace
fervent, and full of apostolic grace
while with congratulations and with prayers
he entertained the angel unawares
robert, the jester, bursting through the crowd
into their presence rushed, and cried aloud
robert, your brother, king of sicily
this man, who wears my semblance to your eyes
is an impostor in a king's disguise
do you not know me? does no voice within
answer my cry, and say we are akin
the pope in silence, but with troubled mien
gazed at the angel's countenance serene
the emperor, laughing, said, "it is strange sport
to keep a mad man for thy fool at court
and the poor, baffled jester, in disgrace
was hustled back among the populace

in solemn state the holy week went by
and easter sunday gleamed upon the sky
the presence of the angel, with its light
before the sun rose, made the city bright
and with new fervor filled the hearts of men
who felt that christ indeed had risen again
even the jester, on his bed of straw
with haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw
he felt within a power unfelt before
and kneeling humbly on his chamber floor
he heard the rustling garments of the lord
sweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward

and now the visit ending, and once more
valmond returning to the danube's shore
homeward the angel journeyed, and again
the land was made resplendent with his train
flashing along the towns of italy
unto salerno, and from thence by sea
and when once more within palermo's wall
and, seated on the throne in his great hall
he heard the angelus from convent towers
as if the better world conversed with ours
he beckoned to king robert to draw nigher
and with a gesture bade the rest retire
and when they were alone, the angel said
king robert crossed both hands upon his breast
and meekly answered him, "thou knowest best
my sins as scarlet are; let me go hence
and in some cloister's school of penitence
across those stones that pave the way to heaven
walk barefoot till my guilty soul be shriven

the angel smiled, and from his radiant face
a holy light illumined all the place
and through the open window, loud and clear
they heard the monks chant in the chapel near
above the stir and tumult of the street
and has exalted them of low degree
and through the chant a second melody
rose like the throbbing of a single string

king robert, who was standing near the throne
lifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone
but all appareled as in days of old
with ermined mantle and with cloth of gold
and when his courtiers came they found him there
kneeling upon the floor, absorbed in silent prayer



it was late in mild october, and the long autumnal rain
had left the summer harvest-fields all green with grass again
the first sharp frosts had fallen, leaving all the woodlands gay
with the hues of summer's rainbow, or the meadow-flowers of may

through a thin, dry mist, that morning, the sun rose broad and red
at first a rayless disk of fire, he brightened as he sped
yet, even his noontide glory fell chastened and subdued
on the cornfields and the orchards, and softly pictured wood

and all that quiet afternoon, slow sloping to the night
he wove with golden shuttle the haze with yellow light
slanting through the painted beeches, he glorified the hill
and beneath it, pond and meadow lay brighter, greener still

and shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of that sky
flecked by the many-tinted leaves, and laughed, they knew not why
and schoolgirls, gay with aster-flowers, beside the meadow brooks
mingled the glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet looks

from spire and ball looked westerly the patient weathercock
but even the birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks
no sound was in the woodlands, save the squirrel's dropping shell
and the yellow leaves among the boughs, low rustling as they fell

the summer grains were harvested; the stubble-fields lay dry
where june winds rolled, in light and shade, the pale green waves of rye
but still, on gentle hill-slopes, in valleys fringed with wood
ungathered, bleaching in the sun, the heavy corn crop stood

bent low, by autumn's wind and rain, through husks that, dry and sere
unfolded by their ripened charge, shone out the yellow ear
beneath, the turnip lay concealed, in many a verdant fold
and glistened in the slanting light the pumpkin's sphere of gold

there wrought the busy harvesters; and many a creaking wain
bore slowly to the long barn-floor its load of husk and grain
till broad and red, as when he rose, the sun sank down, at last
and like a merry guest's farewell, the day in brightness passed

and lo! as through the western pines on meadow, stream, and pond
flamed the red radiance of a sky, set all afire beyond
slowly o'er the eastern sea-bluffs a milder glory shone
and the sunset and the moonrise were mingled into one

as thus into the quiet night the twilight lapsed away
and deeper in the brightening moon the tranquil shadows lay
from many a brown old farm-house, and hamlet without name
their milking and their home-tasks done, the merry huskers came

swung o'er the heaped-up harvest, from pitchforks in the mow
shone dimly down the lanterns on the pleasant scene below
the growing pile of husks behind, the golden ears before
and laughing eyes and busy hands and brown cheeks glimmering o'er

half hidden in a quiet nook, serene of look and heart
talking their old times over, the old men sat apart
while, up and down the unhusked pile, or nestling in its shade
at hide-and-seek, with laugh and shout, the happy children played

urged by the good host's daughter, a maiden young and fair
lifting to light her sweet blue eyes and pride of soft brown hair
the master of the village school, sleek of hair and smooth of tongue
to the quaint tune of some old psalm, a husking-ballad sung



if ever there lived a yankee lad
wise or otherwise, good or bad
who, seeing the birds fly, didn't jump
with flapping arms from stake or stump
or, spreading the tail
of his coat for a sail
take a soaring leap from post or rail
and wonder why
he couldn't fly
and flap and flutter and wish and try
if ever you knew a country dunce
who didn't try that as often as once
all i can say is, that's a sign
he never would do for a hero of mine

an aspiring genius was d. green
the son of a farmer,--age fourteen
his body was long and lank and lean
just right for flying, as will be seen
he had two eyes, each bright as a bean
and a freckled nose that grew between
a little awry,--for i must mention
that he had riveted his attention
upon his wonderful invention
twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings
working his face as he worked the wings
and with every turn of gimlet and screw
turning and screwing his mouth round, too
till his nose seemed bent
to catch the scent
around some corner, of new-baked pies
and his wrinkled cheeks and his squinting eyes
grew puckered into a queer grimace
that made him look very droll in the face
and also very wise

and wise he must have been, to do more
than ever a genius did before
excepting daedalus of yore
and his son icarus, who wore
upon their backs
those wings of wax
he had read of in the old almanacs
darius was clearly of the opinion
that the air is also man's dominion
and that, with paddle or fin or pinion
we soon or late
shall navigate
the azure as now we sail the sea
the thing looks simple enough to me
and if you doubt it
hear how darius reasoned about it

must we give in
says he with a grin
are smarter'n we be
jest fold our hands an' see the swaller
an' blackbird an' catbird beat us holler
does the leetle, chatterin', sassy wren
no bigger'n my thumb, know more than men
jest show me that
er prove 't the bat
has got more brains than's in my hat
an' i'll back down, an' not till then

he argued further: "ner i can't see
what's ta' use o' wings to a bumblebee
fer to git a livin' with, more'n to me
ain't my business
important's his'n is
that icarus
was a silly cuss
him an' his daddy daedalus
they might 'a' knowed wings made o' wax
wouldn't stan' sun-heat an' hard whacks
i'll make mine o' luther
er suthin' er other

and he said to himself, as he tinkered and planned
to mummies that never can understand
the fust idee that's big an' grand
they'd 'a' laft an' made fun
o' creation itself afore't was done
so he kept his secret from all the rest
safely buttoned within his vest
and in the loft above the shed
himself he locks, with thimble and thread
and wax and hammer and buckles and screws
and all such things as geniuses use
two bats for patterns, curious fellows
a charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows
an old hoop-skirt or two, as well as
some wire and several old umbrellas
a carriage-cover, for tail and wings
a piece of harness; and straps and strings
and a big strong boxs
in which he locks
these and a hundred other things

his grinning brothers, reuben and burke
and nathan and jotham and solomon, lurk
around the corner to see him work
sitting cross-legged, like a turk
drawing the waxed end through with a jerk
and boring the holes with a comical quirk
of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk
but vainly they mounted each other's backs
and poked through knot-holes and pried through cracks
with wood from the pile and straw from the stacks
he plugged the knot-holes and calked the cracks
and a bucket of water, which one would think
he had brought up into the loft to drink
when he chanced to be dry
stood always nigh
for darius was sly
and whenever at work he happened to spy
at chink or crevice a blinking eye
he let a dipper of water fly
guess ye'll ketch a weasel asleep
and he sings as he locks
his big strong box

an' he is leetle an' long an' slim
an' quick of motion an' nimble of limb
an' ef yeou'll be
advised by me
keep wide awake when ye're ketchin' him
so day after day
he stitched and tinkered and hammered away
till at last 'twas done
the greatest invention under the sun

and the weather was dry
and not a cloud was on all the sky
save a few light fleeces, which here and there
half mist, half air
like foam on the ocean went floating by
just as lovely a morning as ever was seen
for a nice little trip in a flying-machine

thought cunning darius: "now i sha'n't go
along 'ith the fellers to see the show
i'll say i've got sich a terrible cough
an' then, when the folks 'ave all gone off
i'll hev full swing
for to try the thing
an' practyse a leetle on the wing
says brother nate. "no; botheration
my gracious!--feel's though i should fly

said jotham, "sho
guess ye better go
but darius said, "no
shouldn't wonder 'f yeou might see me, though
o' this jumpin', thumpin' pain 'n my head
for all the while to himself he said
i'll fly a few times around the lot
to see how 't seems, then soon's i've got
the hang o' the thing, ez likely's not
i'll astonish the nation
and all creation
by flyin' over the celebration
over their heads i'll sail like an eagle
i'll balance myself on my wings like a sea-gull
i'll dance on the chimbleys; i'll stan' on the steeple
i'll flop up to winders an' scare the people
i'll light on the libbe'ty-pole, an' crow
an' i'll say to the gawpin' fools below
that i've come near
fer i'll make 'em believe i'm a chap f'm the moon
an' i'll try a race 'ith their ol' bulloon
he crept from his bed
and, seeing the others were gone, he said
i'm a-gittin' over the cold 'n my head
and away he sped
to open the wonderful box in the shed

his brothers had walked but a little way
when jotham to nathan chanced to say
er he wouldn't 'a' stayed to hum to-day
says burke, "his toothache's all 'n his eye
ef he hedn't some machine to try
le's hurry back and hide in the barn
an' pay him fer tellin' us that yarn
along by the fences, behind the stack
and one by one, through a hole in the wall
in under the dusty barn they crawl
dressed in their sunday garments all
and a very astonishing sight was that
when each in his cobwebbed coat and hat
came up through the floor like an ancient rat
and there they hid
and reuben slid
the fastenings back, and the door undid

as knights of old put on their mail
from head to foot
an iron suit
iron jacket and iron boot
iron breeches, and on the head
no hat, but an iron pot instead
and under the chin the bail
i believe they called the thing a helm
and the lid they carried they called a shield
and, thus accoutred, they took the field
sallying forth to overwhelm
the dragons and pagans that plagued the realm
so this modern knight
prepared for flight
put on his wings and strapped them tight
jointed and jaunty, strong and light
buckled them fast to shoulder and hip
ten feet they measured from tip to tip
and a helm had he, but that he wore
not on his head like those of yore
but more like the helm of a ship

he's opened the winder,--i see his head
he stretches it out
an' pokes it about
lookin' to see 'f the coast is clear
an' nobody near
guess he don'o' who's hid in here
he's riggin' a spring-board over the sill
stop laffin', solomon! burke, keep still
he's a climbin' out now--of all the things
what's he got on? i van, it's wings
an' that t'other thing? i vum, it's a tail
an' there he sets like a hawk on a rail
steppin' careful, he travels the length
of his spring-board, and teeters to try its strength
now he stretches his wings, like a monstrous bat
peeks over his shoulder, this way an' that
fer to see 'f the' 's anyone passin' by
but the' 's on'y a ca'f an' a goslin' nigh
to see--the dragon! he's goin' to fly
away he goes! jimmmy! what a jump
flop-flop-an' plump
to the ground with a thump
flutt'rin an' flound'rin', all in a lump

as a demon is hurled by an angel's spear
heels over head, to his proper sphere
heels over head, and head over heels
dizzily down the abyss he wheels
so fell darius. upon his crown
in the midst of the barnyard, he came down
in a wonderful whirl of tangled strings
broken braces and broken springs
broken tail and broken wings
shooting-stars, and various things
away with a bellow fled the calf
and what was that? did the gosling laugh
from the old barn-door
and he hears the voice of jotham crying
slowly, ruefully, where he lay
darius just turned and looked that way
as he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cuff
he said; "but the' ain't sich a thunder-in' sight
o' fun in 't when ye come to light


i just have room for the moral here
and this is the moral,--stick to your sphere
or if you insist, as you have the right
on spreading your wings for a loftier flight
the moral is,--take care how you light



with fingers weary and worn
with eyelids heavy and red
a woman sat, in unwomanly rags
plying her needle and thread
stitch! stitch! stitch
in poverty, hunger and dirt
and still with a voice of dolorous pitch
she sang the "song of the shirt

while the cock is crowing aloof
and work--work--work
till the stars shine through the roof
it's oh! to be a slave
along with the barbarous turk
where a woman has never a soul to save
if this is christian work

till the brain begins to swim
work--work--work
till the eyes are heavy and dim
seam, and gusset, and band
band, and gusset, and seam
till over the buttons i fall asleep
and sew them on in a dream

o men, with mothers and wives
it is not linen you're wearing out
but human creatures' lives
stitch--stitch--stitch
in poverty, hunger, and dirt
sewing at once, with a double thread
a shroud as well as a shirt

that phantom of grisly bone
i hardly fear his terrible shape
it seems so like my own
it seems so like my own
because of the fasts i keep
o god! that bread should be so dear
and flesh and blood so cheap

my labor never flags
and what are its wages? a bed of straw
a crust of bread--and rags
that shattered roof--this naked floor
a table--a broken chair
and a wall so blank, my shadow i thank
for sometimes falling there

from weary chime to chime
work--work--work
as prisoners work for crime
band, and gusset, and seam
seam, and gusset, and band
till the heart is sick and the brain benumbed
as well as the weary hand

in the dull december light
and work--work--work
when the weather is warm, and bright
while underneath the eaves
the brooding swallows cling
as if to show me their sunny backs
and twit me with the spring

of the cowslip and primrose sweet
with the sky above my head
and the grass beneath my feet
for only one short hour
to feel as i used to feel
before i knew the woes of want
and the walk that costs a meal

a respite, however brief
no blessed leisure for love or hope
but only time for grief
a little weeping would ease my heart
but in their briny bed
my tears must stop, for every drop
hinders needle and thread

with fingers weary and worn
with eyelids heavy and red
a woman sat, in unwomanly rags
plying her needle and thread
stitch! stitch! stitch
in poverty, hunger and dirt
and still with a voice of dolorous pitch
would that its tone could reach the rich
she sang this "song of the shirt



everywhere, everywhere, christmas to-night
christmas in lands of the fir-tree and pine
christmas in lands of the palm-tree and vine
christmas where snow-peaks stand solemn and white
christmas where corn-fields lie sunny and bright
everywhere, everywhere, christmas to-night

christmas where children are hopeful and gay
christmas where old men are patient and gray
christmas where peace, like a dove in its flight
broods o'er brave men in the thick of the fight
everywhere, everywhere, christmas tonight

for the christ-child who comes is the master of all
no palace too great and no cottage too small
the angels who welcome him sing from the height
everywhere, everywhere, christmas tonight

then let every heart keep its christmas within
christ's pity for sorrow, christ's hatred of sin
christ's care for the weakest, christ's courage for right
christ's dread of the darkness, christ's love of the light
everywhere, everywhere, christmas tonight

so the stars of the midnight which compass us round
shall see a strange glory, and hear a sweet sound
and cry, "look! the earth is aflame with delight
o sons of the morning, rejoice at the sight
everywhere, everywhere, christmas tonight



i bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers
from the seas and the streams
i bear light shade for the leaves when laid
in their noon-day dreams
from my wings are shaken the dews that waken
the sweet buds every one
when rocked to rest on their mother's breast
as she dances about the sun
i wield the flail of the lashing hail
and whiten the green plains under
and then again i dissolve it in rain
and laugh as i pass in thunder

i sift the snow on the mountains below
and their great pines groan aghast
and all the night 'tis my pillow white
while i sleep in the arms of the blast
sublime on the towers of my skyey bowers
lightning my pilot sits
in a cavern under is fettered the thunder
it struggles and howls at fits
over earth and ocean, with gentle motion
this pilot is guiding me
lured by the love of the genii that move
in the depths of the purple sea
over the rills, and the crags, and the hills
over the lakes and the plains
wherever he dream, under mountain or stream
the spirit he loves remains
and i all the while bask in heaven's blue smile
whilst he is dissolving in rains

the sanguine sunrise, with his meteor eyes
and his burning plumes outspread
leaps on the back of my sailing rack
when the morning star shines dead
as on the jag of a mountain crag
which an earthquake rocks and swings
an eagle alit one moment may sit
in the light of its golden wings
and when sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath
its ardors of rest and of love
and the crimson pall of eve may fall
from the depth of heaven above
with wings folded i rest, on mine airy nest
as still as a brooding dove

that orbed maiden, with white fire laden
whom mortals call the moon
glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor
by the midnight breezes strewn
and wherever the beat of her unseen feet
which only the angels hear
may have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof
the stars peep behind her and peer
and i laugh to see them whirl and flee
like a swarm of golden bees
when i widen the rent in my windbuilt tent
till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas
like strips of the sky fallen thro' me on high
are each paved with the moon and these

i bind the sun's throne with a burning zone
and the moon's with a girdle of pearl
the volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim
when the whirlwinds my banner unfurl
from cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape
over a torrent sea
sunbeam-proof, i hang like a roof
the mountains its columns be
the triumphal arch thro' which i march
with hurricane, fire, and snow
when the powers of the air are chained to my chair
is the million-colored bow
the sphere-fire above its soft colors wove
whilst the moist earth was laughing below

i am the daughter of earth and water
and the nursling of the sky
i pass thro' the pores of the ocean and shores
i change, but i cannot die
for after the rain, when, with never a stain
the pavilion of heaven is bare
and the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams
build up the blue dome of air
i silently laugh at my own cenotaph
and out of the caverns of rain
like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb
i arise and unbuild it again



hail to thee, blithe spirit
bird thou never wert
that from heaven, or near it
pourest thy full heart
in profuse strains of unpremeditated art

higher still and higher
from the earth thou springest
like a cloud of fire
the blue deep thou wingest
and singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest

in the golden lightning
of the sunken sun
o'er which clouds are bright'ning
thou dost float and run
like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun

the pale purple even
melts around thy flight
like a star of heaven
in the broad daylight
thou art unseen, but yet i hear thy shrill delight

keen as are the arrows
of that silver sphere
whose intense lamp narrows
in the white dawn clear
until we hardly see, we feel, that it is there

all the earth and air
with thy voice is loud
as, when night is bare
from one lonely cloud
the moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflowed

what thou art we know not
what is most like thee
from rainbow clouds there flow not
drops so bright to see
as from thy presence showers a rain of melody

like a poet hidden
in the light of thought
singing hymns unbidden
till the world is wrought
to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not

like a high-born maiden
in a palace-tower
soothing her love-laden
soul in secret hour
with music sweet as love, which overflows her bower

like a glow-worm golden
in a dell of dew
scattering unbeholden
its aerial hue
among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view

like a rose embowered
in its own green leaves
by warm winds deflowered
till the scent it gives
makes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves

sound of vernal showers
on the twinkling grass
rain-awakened flowers
all that ever was
joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass

teach us, sprite or bird
what sweet thoughts are thine
i have never heard
praise of love or wine
that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine

chorus hymeneal
or triumphal chaunt
matched with thine would be all
but an empty vaunt
a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want

what objects are the fountains
of thy happy strain
what fields, or waves, or mountains
what shapes of sky or plain
what love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain

with thy clear keen joyance
languor cannot be
shadow of annoyance
never came near thee
thou lovest: but ne'er knew love's sad satiety

waking or asleep
thou of death must deem
things more true and deep
than we mortals dream
or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream

we look before and after
and pine for what is not
our sincerest laughter
with some pain is fraught
our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought

yet if we could scorn
hate, and pride, and fear
if we were things born
not to a shed a tear
i know not how thy joy we ever should come near

better than all measures
of delightful sound
better than all treasures
that in books are found
thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground

teach me half the gladness
that thy brain must know
such harmonious madness
from my lips would flow
the world should listen then, as i am listening now



i come from haunts of coot and hern
i make a sudden sally
and sparkle out among the fern
to bicker down a valley

by thirty hills i hurry down
or slip between the ridges
by twenty thorps, a little town
and half a hundred bridges

till last by philip's farm i flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever

i chatter over stony ways
in little sharps and trebles
i bubble into eddying bays
i babble on the pebbles

with many a curve my banks i fret
by many a field and fallow
and many a fairy foreland set
with willow-weed and mallow

i chatter, chatter as i flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever

i wind about, and in and out
with here a blossom sailing
and here and there a lusty trout
and here and there a grayling

and here and there a foamy flake
upon me as i travel
with many a silvery waterbreak
above the golden gravel

and draw them all along, and flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever

i steal by lawns and grassy plots
i slide by hazel covers
i move the sweet forget-me-nots
that grow for happy lovers

i slip, i slide, i gloom, i glance
among my skimming swallows
i make the netted sunbeam dance
against my sandy shallows

i murmur under moon and stars
in brambly wildernesses
i linger by my shingly bars
i loiter round my cresses

and out again i curve and flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever




no price is set on the lavish summer
june may be had by the poorest comer

and what is so rare as a day in june
then, if ever, come perfect days
then heaven tries earth if it be in tune
and over it softly her warm ear lays
whether we look, or whether we listen
we hear life murmur, or see it glisten
every clod feels a stir of might
an instinct within it that reaches and towers
and, groping blindly above it for light
climbs to a soul in grass and flowers
the flush of life may well be seen
thrilling back over hills and valleys
the cowslip startles in meadows green
the buttercup catches the sun in its chalice
and there's never a leaf nor a blade too mean
to be some happy creature's palace
the little bird sits at his door in the sun
atilt like a blossom among the leaves
and lets his illumined being o'errun
with the deluge of summer it receives
his mate feels the eggs beneath her wings
and the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings
he sings to the wide world, and she to her nest
in the nice ear of nature, which song is the best

now is the high-tide of the year
and whatever of life hath ebbed away
comes flooding back, with a ripply cheer
into every bare inlet and creek and bay
now the heart is so full that a drop overfills it
we are happy now because god wills it
no matter how barren the past may have been
we sit in the warm shade and feel right well
how the sap creeps up and the blossoms swell
we may shut our eyes, but we cannot help knowing
that skies are clear and grass is growing
the breeze comes whispering in our ear
that dandelions are blossoming near
that maize has sprouted, that streams are flowing
that the river is bluer than the sky
that the robin is plastering his house hard by
and if the breeze kept the good news back
for other couriers we should not lack
we could guess it all by yon heifer's lowing
and hark! how clear bold chanticleer
warmed with the new wine of the year
tells all in his lusty crowing

joy comes, grief goes, we know not how
everything is happy now
everything is upward striving
as for grass to be green or skies to be blue
who knows whither the clouds have fled
in the unscarred heaven they leave no wake
and the eyes forget the tears they have shed
the heart forgets its sorrow and ache
the soul partakes the season's youth
and the sulphurous rifts of passion and woe
lie deep 'neath a silence pure and smooth
like burnt-out craters healed with snow



come, let us plant the apple-tree
cleave the tough greensward with the spade
wide let its hollow bed be made
there gently lay the roots, and there
sift the dark mould with kindly care
and press it o'er them tenderly
as round the sleeping infant's feet
we softly fold the cradle-sheet
so plant we the apple tree

what plant we in this apple-tree
buds, which the breath of summer days
shall lengthen into leafy sprays
boughs where the thrush with crimson breast
shall haunt, and sing, and hide her nest
we plant, upon the sunny lea
a shadow for the noontide hour
a shelter from the summer shower
when we plant the apple-tree

what plant we in this apple-tree
sweets for a hundred flowery springs
to load the may-wind's restless wings
when, from the orchard row, he pours
its fragrance through our open doors
a world of blossoms for the bee
flowers for the sick girl's silent room
for the glad infant sprigs of bloom
we plant with the apple-tree

what plant we in this apple-tree
fruits that shall swell in sunny june
and redden in the august noon
and drop, when gentle airs come by
that fan the blue september sky
while children come, with cries of glee
and seek them where the fragrant grass
betrays their bed to those who pass
at the foot of the apple tree

and when, above this apple tree
the winter stars are quivering bright
and winds go howling through the night
girls, whose young eyes o'erflow with mirth
shall peel its fruit by cottage hearth
and guests in prouder homes shall see
heaped with the grape of cintra's vine
and golden orange of the line
the fruit of the apple-tree

the fruitage of this apple-tree
winds, and our flag of stripe and star
shall bear to coasts that lie afar
where men shall wonder at the view
and ask in what fair groves they grew
and sojourners beyond the sea
shall think of childhood's careless day
and long, long hours of summer play
in the shade of the apple-tree

each year shall give this apple-tree
a broader flush of roseate bloom
a deeper maze of verdurous gloom
and loosen, when the frost-clouds lower
the crisp brown leaves in thicker shower
the years shall come and pass, but we
shall hear no longer, where we lie
the summer's songs, the autumn's sigh
in the boughs of the apple-tree

and time shall waste this apple tree
oh, when its aged branches throw
thin shadows on the ground below
shall fraud and force and iron will
oppress the weak and helpless still
what shall the tasks of mercy be
amid the toils, the strifes, the tears
of those who live when length of years
is wasting this apple-tree

the children of that distant day
thus to some aged man shall say
and, gazing on its mossy stem
the gray-haired man shall answer them
born in the rude but good old times
on planting the apple-tree



who is the happy warrior? who is he
that every man in arms should wish to be
among the tasks of real life, hath wrought
upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought
whose high endeavors are an inward light
that makes the path before him always bright
who, with a natural instinct to discern
what knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn
abides by this resolve, and stops not there
but makes his moral being his prime care
who, doomed to go in company with pain
and fear, and bloodshed, miserable train
turns his necessity to glorious gain
in face of these doth exercise a power
which is our human nature's highest dower
controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves
of their bad influence, and their good receives
by objects, which might force the soul to abate
her feeling, rendered more compassionate
is placable--because occasions rise
so often that demand such sacrifice
more skillful in self-knowledge, even more pure
as tempted more; more able to endure
as more exposed to suffering and distress
thence also, more alive to tenderness
upon that law as on the best of friends
whence, in a state where men are tempted still
to evil for a guard against worse ill
and what in quality or act is best
doth seldom on a right foundation rest
he labors good on good to fix, and owes
to virtue every triumph that he knows
rises by open means; and there will stand
on honorable terms, or else retire
and in himself possess his own desire
who comprehends his trust, and to the same
keeps faithful with a singleness of aim
and therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait
for wealth, or honors, or for worldly state
whom they must follow; on whose head must fall
like showers of manna, if they come at all
whose powers shed round him in the common strife
or mild concerns of ordinary life
a constant influence, a peculiar grace
but who, if he be called upon to face
some awful moment to which heaven has joined
great issues, good or bad for human kind
is happy as a lover; and attired
with sudden brightness, like a man inspired
and, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law
in calmness made, and sees what he foresaw
or if an unexpected call succeed
come when it will, is equal to the need
and faculty for storm and turbulence
is yet a soul whose master-bias leans
to homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes
sweet images! which, wheresoe'er he be
are at his heart; and such fidelity
it is his darling passion to approve
more brave for this, that he hath much to love
conspicuous object in a nation's eye
or left unthought-of in obscurity
who, with a toward or untoward lot
prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not
plays, in the many games of life, that one
where what he most doth value must be won
whom neither shape of danger can dismay
nor thought of tender happiness betray
who, not content that former worth stand fast
looks forward, persevering to the last
from well to better, daily self-surpast
who, whether praise of him must walk the earth
forever, and to noble deeds give birth
or he must fall, to sleep without his fame
and leave a dead unprofitable name
finds comfort in himself and in his cause
and, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws
his breath in confidence of heaven's applause
this is the happy warrior; this is he
that every man in arms should wish to be



half a league, half a league
half a league onward
all in the valley of death
rode the six hundred
charge for the guns," he said
into the valley of death
rode the six hundred

was there a man dismay'd
not tho' the soldier knew
some one had blunder'd
theirs not to make reply
theirs not to reason why
theirs but to do and die
into the valley of death
rode the six hundred

cannon to right of them
cannon to left of them
cannon in front of them
volley'd and thunder'd
storm'd at with shot and shell
boldly they rode and well
into the jaws of death
into the mouth of hell
rode the six hundred

flash'd all their sabres bare
flash'd as they turn'd in air
sabring the gunners there
charging an army, while
all the world wonder'd
plung'd in the battery-smoke
right thro' the line they broke
cossack and russian
reel'd from the sabre-stroke
shatter'd and sunder'd
then they rode back, but not
not the six hundred

cannon to right of them
cannon to left of them
cannon behind them
volley'd and thunder'd
storm'd at with shot and shell
while horse and hero fell
they that had fought so well
came thro' the jaws of death
back from the mouth of hell
all that was left of them
left of six hundred

when can their glory fade
o the wild charge they made
all the world wonder'd
honor the charge they made
honor the light brigade
noble six hundred



october 19, 1864

up from the south at break of day
bringing to winchester fresh dismay
the affrighted air with a shudder bore
like a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door
the terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar
telling the battle was on once more
and sheridan--twenty miles away

and wider still those billows of war
thundered along the horizon's bar
and louder yet into winchester rolled
the roar of that red sea uncontrolled
making the blood of the listener cold
as he thought of the stake in that fiery fray
and sheridan--twenty miles away

but there is a road from winchester town
a good broad highway leading down
and there, through the flush of the morning light
a steed, as black as the steeds of night
was seen to pass, as with eagle flight
as if he knew the terrible need
he stretched away with the utmost speed
hills rose and fell--but his heart was gay
with sheridan fifteen miles away

still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering south
the dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth
or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster
foreboding to foemen the doom of disaster
the heart of the steed and the heart of the master
were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls
impatient to be where the battle-field calls
every nerve of the charger was strained to full play
with sheridan only ten miles away

under his spurning feet the road
like an arrowy alpine river flowed
and the landscape sped away behind
like an ocean flying before the wind
and the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire
swept on, with his wild eyes full of fire
but lo! he is nearing his heart's desire
he is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray
with sheridan only five miles away

the first that the general saw were the groups
of stragglers, and then the retreating troops
what was done? what to do? a glance told him both
then striking his spurs, with a terrible oath
he dashed down the line 'mid a storm of huzzas
and the wave of retreat checked its course there, because
the sight of the master compelled it to pause
with foam and with dust the black charger was gray
by the flash of his eye and the red nostril's play
he seemed to the whole great army to say
from winchester down to save the day

hurrah, hurrah for sheridan
hurrah, hurrah for horse and man
and when their statues are placed on high
under the dome of the union sky
the american soldier's temple of fame
there, with the glorious general's name
be it said in letters both bold and bright
by carrying sheridan into the fight
from winchester--twenty miles away



o little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee to-night

for christ is born of mary
and, gathered all above
while mortals sleep, the angels keep
their watch of wondering love
o morning stars, together
proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth

how silently, how silently
the wondrous gift is given
so god imparts to human hearts
the blessings of his heaven
no ear may hear his coming
but in this world of sin
where meek souls will receive him still
the dear christ enters in

o holy child of bethlehem
descend to us, we pray
cast out our sin, and enter in
be born in us to-day
we hear the christmas angels
the great glad tidings tell
oh, come to us, abide with us
our lord emmanuel



this is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign
sails the unshadowed main
the venturous bark that flings
on the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
in gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings
and coral reefs lie bare
where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair

its webs of living gauze no more unfurl
wrecked is the ship of pearl
and every chambered cell
where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell
as the frail tenant shaped his growing shell
before thee lies revealed
its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed

year after year beheld the silent toil
that spread his lustrous coil
still, as the spiral grew
he left the past year's dwelling for the new
stole with soft step its shining archway through
built up its idle door
stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more

thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee
child of the wandering sea
cast from her lap, forlorn
from thy dead lips a clearer note is born
than ever triton blew from wreathed horn
while on mine ear it rings
through the deep caves of thought i hear a voice that sings

build thee more stately mansions, o my soul
as the swift seasons roll
leave thy low-vaulted past
let each new temple, nobler than the last
shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast
till thou at length art free
leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea



true worth is in _being_, not _seeming
in doing, each day that goes by
some little good--not in dreaming
of great things to do by and by
for whatever men say in their blindness
and spite of the fancies of youth
there's nothing so kingly as kindness
and nothing so royal as truth

we get back our mete as we measure
we cannot do wrong and feel right
nor can we give pain and gain pleasure
for justice avenges each slight
the air for the wing of the sparrow
the bush for the robin and wren
but alway the path that is narrow
and straight, for the children of men

the heart of its ills to beguile
though he who makes courtship to glory
gives all that he hath for her smile
for when from her heights he has won her
alas! it is only to prove
that nothing's so sacred as honor
and nothing so loyal as love

we cannot make bargains for blisses
nor catch them like fishes in nets
and sometimes the thing our life misses
helps more than the thing which it gets
for good lieth not in pursuing
nor gaining of great nor of small
but just in the doing, and doing
as we would be done by, is all

through envy, through malice, through hating
against the world, early and late
no jot of our courage abating
our part is to work and to wait
and slight is the sting of his trouble
whose winnings are less than his worth
for he who is honest is noble
whatever his fortunes or birth



who has seen the wind
neither i nor you
but when the leaves hang trembling
the wind is passing through

who has seen the wind
but when the trees bow down their heads
the wind is passing by



the owl and the pussy-cat went to sea
in a beautiful pea-green boat
they took some honey, and plenty of money
wrapped up in a five-pound note
the owl looked up to the moon above
and sang to a small guitar
what a beautiful pussy you are
you are
what a beautiful pussy you are

pussy said to the owl, "you elegant fowl
how wonderful sweet you sing
oh, let us be married,--too long we have tarried
but what shall we do for a ring
they sailed away for a year and a day
to the land where the bong-tree grows
and there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood
with a ring in the end of his nose
his nose
with a ring in the end of his nose

your ring?" said the piggy, "i will
so they took it away, and were married next day
by the turkey who lives on the hill
they dined upon mince and slices of quince
which they ate with a runcible spoon
and hand in hand on the edge of the sand
they danced by the light of the moon
the moon
they danced by the light of the moon



the frost looked forth one still, clear night
and whispered, "now i shall be out of sight
so through the valley and over the height
in silence i'll take my way
i will not go on like that blustering train
the wind and the snow, the hail and the rain
that make so much bustle and noise in vain
but i'll be as busy as they

so he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest
he lit on the trees, and their boughs he drest
in diamond beads--and over the breast
of the quivering lake he spread
a coat of mail, that it need not fear
the downward point of many a spear
that he hung on its margin, far and near
where a rock could rear its head

he went to the windows of those who slept
and over each pane like a fairy crept
wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped
by the light of the morn were seen
most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees
there were bevies of birds and swarms of bees
there were cities with temples and towers; and these
all pictured in silver sheen

but he did one thing that was hardly fair
he peeped in the cupboard, and finding there
that all had forgotten for him to prepare
i'll bite this basket of fruit," said he
and the glass of water they've left for me
shall 'tchick!' to tell them i'm drinking



heap high the farmer's wintry hoard
heap high the golden corn
no richer gift has autumn poured
from out her lavish horn

let other lands, exulting, glean
the apple from the pine
the orange from its glossy green
the cluster from the vine

we better love the hardy gift
our rugged vales bestow
to cheer us when the storm shall drift
our harvest-fields with snow

through vales of grass and meads of flowers
our plows their furrows made
while on the hills the sun and showers
of changeful april played

we dropped the seed o'er hill and plain
beneath the sun of may
and frightened from our sprouting grain
the robber crows away

all through the long, bright days of june
its leaves grew green and fair
and waved in hot midsummer's noon
its soft and yellow hair

and now, with autumn's moonlit eyes
its harvest time has come
we pluck away the frosted leaves
and bear the treasure home

there, richer than the fabled gift
apollo showered of old
fair hands the broken grain shall sift
and knead its meal of gold

let vapid idlers loll in silk
around their costly board
give us the bowl of samp and milk
by homespun beauty poured

where'er the wide old kitchen hearth
sends up its smoky curls
who will not thank the kindly earth
and bless our farmer girls

then shame on all the proud and vain
whose folly laughs to scorn
the blessing of our hardy grain
our wealth of golden corn

let earth withhold her goodly root
let mildew blight her rye
give to the worm the orchard's fruit
the wheat-field to the fly

but let the good old crop adorn
the hills our fathers trod
still let us, for his golden corn
send up our thanks to god



when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days, in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
to serve therewith my maker, and present
my true account, lest he, returning, chide
i fondly ask. but patience, to prevent
that murmur, soon replies, "god doth not need
either man's work or his own gifts. who best
bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. his state
is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed
and post o'er land and ocean without rest
they also serve who only stand and wait



where the pools are bright and deep
where the gray trout lies asleep
up the river and o'er the lea
that's the way for billy and me

where the blackbird sings the latest
where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest
where the nestlings chirp and flee
that's the way for billy and me

where the mowers mow the cleanest
where the hay lies thick and greenest
there to trace the homeward bee
that's the way for billy and me

where the hazel bank is steepest
where the shadow falls the deepest
where the clustering nuts fall free
that's the way for billy and me

why the boys should drive away
little sweet maidens from their play
or love to banter and fight so well
that's the thing i never could tell

but this i know, i love to play
through the meadow, among the hay
up the water and o'er the lea
that's the way for billy and me



the leaves are fading and falling
the winds are rough and wild
the birds have ceased their calling
but let me tell you, my child

though day by day, as it closes
doth darker and colder grow
the roots of the bright red roses
will keep alive in the snow

and when the winter is over
the boughs will get new leaves
the quail come back to the clover
and the swallow back to the eaves

there must be rough, cold weather
and winds and rains so wild
not all good things together
come to us here, my child

so, when some dear joy loses
its beauteous summer glow
think how the roots of the roses
are kept alive in the snow



what does little birdie say
in her nest at peep of day
till the little wings are stronger
so she rests a little longer
then she flies away

what does little baby say
in her bed at peep of day
baby says, like little birdie
till the little limbs are stronger
if she sleeps a little longer
baby, too, shall fly away



up the airy mountain
down the rushy glen
we daren't go a-hunting
for fear of little men
wee folk, good folk
trooping all together
green jacket, red cap
and white owl's feather

down along the rocky shore
some make their home
they live on crispy pancakes
of yellow tide foam
some in the reeds
of the black mountain-lake
with frogs for their watch dogs
all night awake

high on the hill-top
the old king sits
he is now so old and gray
he's nigh lost his wits
with a bridge of white mist
columbkill he crosses
on his stately journeys
from slieveleague to rosses
or going up with music
on cold, starry nights
to sup with the queen
of the gay northern lights

by the craggy hillside
through the mosses bare
they have planted thorn trees
for pleasure here and there
is any man so daring
as dig them up in spite
he shall find their sharpest thorns
in his bed at night

up the airy mountain
down the rushy glen
we daren't go a-hunting
for fear of little men
wee folk, good folk
trooping all together
green jacket, red cap
and white owl's feather



great, wide, beautiful, wonderful world
with the wonderful water round you curled
and the wonderful grass upon your breast
world, you are beautifully drest

the wonderful air is over me
and the wonderful wind is shaking the tree
it walks on the water, and whirls the mills
and talks to itself on the top of the hills

you friendly earth, how far do you go
with the wheat-fields that nod and the rivers that flow
with cities and gardens, and cliffs and isles
and people upon you for thousands of miles

ah! you are so great, and i am so small
i hardly can think of you, world, at all
and yet, when i said my prayers today
a whisper within me seemed to say
you can love and think, and the earth can not



be strong
we are not here to play, to dream, to drift
we have hard work to do, and loads to lift
shun not the struggle--face it; 'tis god's gift

be strong
say not, "the days are evil. who's to blame
and fold the hands and acquiesce--oh shame
stand up, speak out, and bravely, in god's name

be strong
it matters not how deep intrenched the wrong
how hard the battle goes, the day how long
faint not--fight on! to-morrow comes the song



when cats run home and light is come
and dew is cold upon the ground
and the far-off stream is dumb
and the whirring sail goes round
and the whirring sail goes round
alone and warming his five wits
the white owl in the belfry sits

when merry milkmaids click the latch
and rarely smells the new-mown hay
and the cock hath sung beneath the thatch
twice or thrice his roundelay
twice or thrice his roundelay
alone and warming his five wits
the white owl in the belfry sits



fame, love and fortune on my footsteps wait
cities and fields i walk: i penetrate
deserts and fields remote, and, passing by
hovel and mart and palace, soon or late
i knock unbidden once at every gate
if sleeping, wake: if feasting, rise before
i turn away. it is the hour of fate
and they who follow me reach every state
mortals desire, and conquer every foe
save death; but those who doubt or hesitate
condemned to failure, penury and woe
seek me in vain and uselessly implore
i answer not, and i return no more



they do me wrong who say i come no more
when once i knock and fail to find you in
for every day i stand outside your door
and bid you wake and rise to fight and win

wail not for precious chances passed away
weep not for golden ages on the wane
each night i burn the records of the day
at sunrise every soul is born again

laugh like a boy at splendors that have sped
to vanished joys be blind and deaf and dumb
my judgments seal the dead past with its dead
but never bind a moment yet to come

though deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep
i lend an arm to all who say: "i can
no shamefac'd outcast ever sank so deep
but yet might rise and be again a man

dost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast
dost reel from righteous retribution's blow
then turn from blotted archives of the past
and find the future's pages white as snow

art thou a mourner? rouse thee from thy spell
art thou a sinner? sins may be forgiven
each morning gives thee wings to flee from hell
each night a star to guide thy feet to heaven




sweet and low, sweet and low
wind of the western sea
low, low, breathe and blow
wind of the western sea
over the rolling waters go
come from the dying moon, and blow
blow him again to me
while my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps

sleep and rest, sleep and rest
father will come to thee soon
rest, rest, on mother's breast
father will come to thee soon
father will come to his babe in the nest
silver sails all out of the west
under the silver moon
sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep



blessings on thee, little man
barefoot boy, with cheek of tan
with thy turned-up pantaloons
and thy merry whistled tunes
with thy red lip, redder still
kissed by strawberries on the hill
with the sunshine on thy face
through thy torn brim's jaunty grace
from, my heart i give thee joy
i was once a barefoot boy
prince thou art,--the grown-up man
only is republican
let the million-dollared ride
barefoot, trudging at his side
thou hast more than he can buy
in the reach of ear and eye
outward sunshine, inward joy
blessings on thee, barefoot boy

o for boyhood's painless play
sleep that wakes in laughing day
health that mocks the doctor's rules
knowledge never learned of schools
of the wild bee's morning chase
of the wild-flower's time and place
flight of fowl and habitude
of the tenants of the wood
how the tortoise bears his shell
how the woodchuck digs his cell
and the ground-mole sinks his well
how the robin feeds her young
how the oriole's nest is hung
where the whitest lilies blow
where the freshest berries grow
where the groundnut trails its vine
where the wood-grape's clusters shine
of the black wasp's cunning way
mason of his walls of clay
and the architectural plans
of gray hornet artisans
for, eschewing books and tasks
nature answers all he asks
hand in hand with her he walks
face to face with her he talks
part and parcel of her joy
blessings on the barefoot boy

o for boyhood's time of june
crowding years in one brief moon
when all things i heard or saw
me, their master, waited for
i was rich in flowers and trees
humming-birds and honey-bees
for my sport the squirrel played
plied the snouted mole his spade
for my taste the blackberry cone
purpled over hedge and stone
laughed the brook for my delight
through the day and through the night
whispering at the garden wall
talked with me from fall to fall
mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond
mine the walnut slopes beyond
mine, on bending orchard trees
apples of hesperides
still as my horizon grew
larger grew my riches too
all the world i saw or knew
seemed a complex chinese toy
fashioned for a barefoot boy

o for festal dainties spread
like my bowl of milk and bread
pewter spoon and bowl of wood
on the door-stone, gray and rude
o'er me, like a regal tent
cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent
purple-curtained, fringed with gold
looped in many a wind-swung fold
while for music came the play
of the pied frogs' orchestra
and, to light the noisy choir
lit the fly his lamp of fire
i was monarch: pomp and joy
waited on the barefoot boy

cheerily, then, my little man
live and laugh, as boyhood can
though the flinty slopes be hard
stubble-speared the new-mown sward
every morn shall lead thee through
fresh baptisms of the dew
every evening from thy feet
shall the cool wind kiss the heat
all too soon these feet must hide
in the prison cells of pride
lose the freedom of the sod
like a colt's for work be shod
made to tread the mills of toil
up and down in ceaseless moil
happy if their track be found
never on forbidden ground
happy if they sink not in
quick and treacherous sands of sin
ah! that thou couldst know thy joy
ere it passes, barefoot boy




there,--my blessing with you
and these few precepts in thy memory
see thou character.--give thy thoughts no tongue
nor any unproportion'd thought his act
be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar
the friends thou hast, and their adoption tried
grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. beware
of entrance to a quarrel; but being in
bear't that the opposed may beware of thee
give every man thine ear, but few thy voice
take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
but not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy
for the apparel oft proclaims the man
neither a borrower nor a lender be
for loan oft loses both itself and friend
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
this above all: to thine own self be true
and it must follow, as the night the day
thou canst not then be false to any man



the mountain and the squirrel
had a quarrel
and the former called the latter "little prig
bun replied
but all sorts of things and weather
must be taken in together
to make up a year
and a sphere
and i think it no disgrace
to occupy my place
if i'm not so large as you
and not half as spry
i'll not deny you make
a very pretty squirrel track
talents differ; all is well and wisely put
if i cannot carry forests on my back
neither can you crack a nut



suppose, my little lady
your doll should break her head
could you make it whole by crying
till your eyes and nose are red
and wouldn't it be pleasanter
to treat it as a joke
and say you're glad "'twas dolly's
and not your head that broke

suppose you're dressed for walking
and the rain comes pouring down
will it clear off any sooner
because you scold and frown
and wouldn't it be nicer
for you to smile than pout
and so make sunshine in the house
when there is none without

suppose your task, my little man
is very hard to get
will it make it any easier
for you to sit and fret
and wouldn't it be wiser
than waiting like a dunce
to go to work in earnest
and learn the thing at once

suppose that some boys have a horse
and some a coach and pair
will it tire you less while walking
to say, "it isn't fair
and wouldn't it be nobler
to keep your temper sweet
and in your heart be thankful
you can walk upon your feet

and suppose the world don't please you
nor the way some people do
do you think the whole creation
will be altered just for you
and isn't it, my boy or girl
the wisest, bravest plan
whatever comes, or doesn't come
to do the best you can



i like little pussy
her coat is so warm
and if i don't hurt her
she'll do me no harm
so i'll not pull her tail
nor drive her away
very gently will play
she shall sit by my side
and i'll give her some food
and she'll love me because
i am gentle and good

i'll pat little pussy
and then she will purr
and thus show her thanks
for my kindness to her
i'll not pinch her ears
nor tread on her paw
lest i should provoke her
to use her sharp claw
i never will vex her
nor make her displeased
for pussy don't like
to be worried or teased



over the river and through the wood
to grandfather's house we go
the horse knows the way
to carry the sleigh
through the white and drifted snow

over the river and through the wood
oh, how the wind does blow
it stings the toes
and bites the nose
as over the ground we go

over the river and through the wood
trot fast, my dapple gray
spring over the ground
like a hunting hound
for this is thanksgiving-day

over the river and through the wood
and straight through the barnyard gate
we seem to go
extremely slow
it is so hard to wait

over the river and through the wood
now grandmother's cap i spy
hurrah for the fun
is the pudding done
hurrah for the pumpkin pie



i wandered lonely as a cloud
that floats on high o'er vales and hills
when all at once i saw a crowd
a host, of golden daffodils
beside the lake, beneath the trees
fluttering and dancing in the breeze

continuous as the stars that shine
and twinkle on the milky way
they stretched in never-ending line
along the margin of a bay
ten thousand saw i at a glance
tossing their heads in sprightly dance

the waves beside them danced; but they
outdid the sparkling waves in glee
a poet could not but be gay
in such a jocund company
i gazed--and gazed--but little thought
what wealth the show to me had brought

for oft, when on my couch i lie
in vacant or in pensive mood
they flash upon that inward eye
which is the bliss of solitude
and then my heart with pleasure fills
and dances with the daffodils



i've watched you now a full half-hour
self-poised upon that yellow flower
and, little butterfly! indeed
i know not if you sleep or feed
more motionless! and then
how motionless!--not frozen seas
what joy awaits you, when the breeze
hath found you out among the trees
and calls you forth again
this plot of orchard-ground is ours
my trees they are, my sister's flowers
here rest your wings when they are weary
here lodge as in a sanctuary
come often to us, fear no wrong
sit near us on the bough
we'll talk of sunshine and of song
and summer days when we were young
sweet childish days, that were as long
as twenty days are now



thou blossom bright with autumn dew
and colored with the heaven's own blue
that openest when the quiet light
succeeds the keen and frosty night

thou comest not when violets lean
o'er wandering brooks and springs unseen
or columbines, in purple dressed
nod o'er the ground-bird's hidden nest

thou waitest late and com'st alone
when woods are bare and birds are flown
and frosts and shortening days portend
the aged year is near his end

then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
look through its fringes to the sky
blue--blue--as if that sky let fall
a flower from its cerulean wall

i would that thus, when i shall see
the hour of death draw near to me
hope, blossoming within my heart
may look to heaven as i depart



the outer trenches guarding
when the heated guns of the camps allied
grew weary of bombarding

the dark redan, in silent scoff
lay, grim and threatening, under
and the tawny mound of the malakoff
no longer belched its thunder

there was a pause. a guardsman said
sing while we may, another day
will bring enough of sorrow

they lay along the battery's side
below the smoking cannon
brave hearts, from severn and from clyde
and from the banks of shannon

they sang of love, and not of fame
forgot was britain's glory
each heart recalled a different name
but all sang "annie laurie

voice after voice caught up the song
until its tender passion
rose like an anthem, rich and strong
their battle-eve confession

dear girl, her name he dared not speak
but, as the song grew louder
something upon the soldier's cheek
washed off the stains of powder

beyond the darkening ocean burned
the bloody sunset's embers
while the crimean valleys learned
how english love remembers

and once again a fire of hell
rained on the russian quarters
with scream of shot, and burst of shell
and bellowing of the mortars

and irish nora's eyes are dim
for a singer, dumb and gory
and english mary mourns for him
who sang of "annie laurie

sleep, soldiers! still in honored rest
your truth and valor wearing
the bravest are the tenderest
the loving are the daring



she walks in beauty, like the night
of cloudless climes and starry skies
and all that's best of dark and bright
meet in her aspect and her eyes
thus mellowed to that tender light
which heaven to gaudy day denies

one shade the more, one ray the less
had half impaired the nameless grace
which waves in every raven tress
or softly lightens o'er her face
where thoughts serenely sweet express
how pure, how dear their dwelling-place

and on that cheek, and o'er that brow
so soft, so calm, yet eloquent
the smiles that win, the tints that glow
but tell of days in goodness spent
a mind at peace with all below
a heart whose love is innocent



all are architects of fate
working in these walls of time
some with massive deeds and great
some with ornaments of rhyme

nothing useless is, or low
each thing in its place is best
and what seems but idle show
strengthens and supports the rest

for the structure that we raise
time is with materials filled
our to-days and yesterdays
are the blocks with which we build

truly shape and fashion these
leave no yawning gaps between
think not, because no man sees
such things will remain unseen

in the elder days of art
builders wrought with greatest care
each minute and unseen part
for the gods see everywhere

let us do our work as well
both the unseen and the seen
make the house, where gods may dwell
beautiful, entire, and clean

else our lives are incomplete
standing in these walls of time
broken stairways, where the feet
stumble as they seek to climb

build to-day, then, strong and sure
with a firm and ample base
and ascending and secure
shall to-morrow find its place

thus alone can we attain
to those turrets, where the eye
sees the world as one vast plain
and one boundless reach of sky



there's a merry brown thrush sitting up in the tree
he's singing to me! he's singing to me
and what does he say, little girl, little boy
don't you hear? don't you see
hush! look! in my tree
i'm as happy as happy can be

and the brown thrush keeps singing, "a nest do you see
and five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree
don't meddle! don't touch! little girl, little boy
or the world will lose some of its joy
now i'm glad! now i'm free
and i always shall be
if you never bring sorrow to me

so the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree
to you and to me, to you and to me
and he sings all the day, little girl, little boy
but long it won't be
don't you know? don't you see
unless we are as good as can be




the quality of mercy is not strain'd
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath. it is twice bless'd
it blesseth him that gives and him that takes
the throned monarch better than his crown
his sceptre shows the force of temporal power
the attribute to awe and majesty
wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
but mercy is above this sceptred sway
it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
it is an attribute to god himself
and earthly power doth then show likest god's
when mercy seasons justice. therefore, jew
though justice be thy plea, consider this
that, in the course of justice, none of us
should see salvation: we do pray for mercy
and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
the deeds of mercy



if you've tried and have not won
never stop for crying
all's that's great and good is done
just by patient trying

though young birds, in flying, fall
still their wings grow stronger
and the next time they can keep
up a little longer

though the sturdy oak has known
many a blast that bowed her
she has risen again, and grown
loftier and prouder

if by easy work you beat
who the more will prize you
gaining victory from defeat
that's the test that tries you



you know we french stormed ratisbon
a mile or so away
on a little mound, napoleon
stood on our storming-day
with neck out-thrust, you fancy how
legs wide, arms locked behind
as if to balance the prone brow
oppressive with its mind
just as perhaps he mused, "my plans
that soar, to earth may fall
let once my army-leader lannes
waver at yonder wall
out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew
a rider, bound on bound
full-galloping; nor bridle drew
until he reached the mound

then off there flung in smiling joy
and held himself erect
by just his horse's mane, a boy
you hardly could suspect
scarce any blood came through
you looked twice ere you saw his breast
was all but shot in two

we've got you ratisbon
the marshall's in the market-place
and you'll be there anon
to see your flag-bird flap his vans
where i, to heart's desire
perched him!" the chief's eye flashed; his plans
soared up again like fire

the chief's eye flashed; but presently
softened itself, as sheathes
a film the mother-eagle's eye
when her bruised eaglet breathes
touched to the quick, he said
smiling, the boy fell dead




the splendor falls on castle walls
and snowy summits old in story
the long light shakes across the lakes
and the wild cataract leaps in glory
blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying
blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying

o hark, o hear! how thin and clear
and thinner, clearer, farther going
the horns of elfland faintly blowing
blow, let us hear the purple glens replying
blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying

o love, they die in yon rich sky
they faint on hill or field or river
our echoes roll from soul to soul
and grow for ever and for ever
blow bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying
and answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying




they say that god lives very high
but if you look above the pines
you cannot see our god; and why

and if you dig down in the mines
you never see him in the gold
though from him all that's glory shines

god is so good, he wears a fold
of heaven and earth across his face
like secrets kept for love untold

but still i feel that his embrace
slides down by thrills through all things made
through sight and sound of every place

as if my tender mother laid
on my shut lips her kisses' pressure
half waking me at night, and said



by the flow of the inland river
where the fleets of iron have fled
where the blades of grave grass quiver
asleep are the ranks of the dead
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
under the one, the blue
under the other, the gray

these in the robings of glory
those in the gloom of defeat
all, with the battle blood gory
in the dusk of eternity meet
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
under the laurel, the blue
under the willow, the gray

from the silence of sorrowful hours
the desolate mourners go
lovingly laden with flowers
alike for the friend and the foe
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
under the roses, the blue
under the lilies, the gray

so with an equal splendor
the morning sun-rays fall
with a touch impartially tender
on the blossoms blooming for all
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
mellowed with gold, the gray

so, when the summer calleth
on forest and field of grain
with an equal murmur falleth
the cooling drip of the rain
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
wet with the rain, the blue
wet with the rain, the gray

sadly, but not with upbraiding
the generous deed was done
in the storm of the years that are fading
no braver battle was won
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
under the blossoms, the blue
under the garlands, the gray

no more shall the war-cry sever
or the winding rivers be red
they banish our anger forever
when they laurel the graves of our dead
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
love and tears for the blue
tears and love for the gray



a fair little girl sat under a tree
sewing as long as her eyes could see
then smoothed her work, and folded it right
and said, "dear work, good night, good night

such a number of rooks came over her head
crying "caw, caw," on their way to bed
she said, as she watched their curious flight

the horses neighed, and the oxen lowed
the sheep's "bleat, bleat" came over the road
and all seemed to say, with a quiet delight

she did not say to the sun "good night
tho' she saw him there like a ball of light
for she knew he had god's own time to keep
all over the world, and never could sleep

the tall pink foxglove bowed his head
the violets curtseyed and went to bed
and good little lucy tied up her hair
and said, on her knees, her favorite prayer

and, while on her pillow she softly lay
she knew nothing more till again it was day
and all things said to the beautiful sun




resting to sleep
why look so pale and so sad, as for ever
wishing to weep

you are too bold
i must obey my dear father above me
and do as i'm told





breathes there the man with soul so dead
who never to himself hath said
this is my own, my native land
whose heart hath ne'er within him burned
as home his footsteps he hath turned
from wandering on a foreign strand
if such there breathe, go, mark him well
for him no minstrel raptures swell
high though his titles, proud his name
boundless his wealth as wish can claim
despite those titles, power, and pelf
the wretch, concentred all in self
living, shall forfeit fair renown
and, doubly dying, shall go down
to the vile dust from whence he sprung
unwept, unhonored and unsung



the year's at the spring
and day's at the morn
morning's at seven
the hillside's dew-pearled
the lark's on the wing
the snail's on the thorn
god's in his heaven
all's right with the world



twinkle, twinkle, little star
how i wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky

when the glorious sun is set
when the grass with dew is wet
then you show your little light
twinkle, twinkle, all the night

in the dark blue sky you keep
and often through my curtains peep
for you never shut your eye
till the sun is in the sky

as your bright and tiny spark
lights the traveler in the dark
though i know not what you are
twinkle, twinkle, little star



sunset and evening star
and one clear call for me
and may there be no moaning of the bar
when i put out to sea

but such a tide as moving seems asleep
too full for sound and foam
when that which drew from out the boundless deep
turns again home

twilight and evening bell
and after that the dark
and may there be no sadness of farewell
when i embark

for tho' from out our bourne of time and place
the flood may bear me far
i hope to see my pilot face to face
when i have crost the bar



the tree's early leaf buds were bursting their brown
till the blossoms have grown
prayed the tree, while he trembled from rootlet to crown

the tree bore his blossoms, and all the birds sung
till the blossoms have grown
said the tree, while his leaflets quivering hung

the tree bore his fruit in the midsummer glow
said the child, "may i gather thy berries now
take them; all are for thee
said the tree, while he bent down his laden boughs low



into the sunshine
full of the light
leaping and flashing
from morn till night

into the moonlight
whiter than snow
waving so flower-like
when the winds blow

into the starlight
rushing in spray
happy at midnight
happy by day

ever in motion
blithesome and cheery
still climbing heavenward
never aweary

glad of all weathers
still seeming best
upward or downward
motion thy rest

full of a nature
nothing can tame
changed every moment
ever the same

ceaseless aspiring
ceaseless content
darkness or sunshine
thy element

glorious fountain
let my heart be
fresh, changeful, constant
upward, like thee



the good dame looked from her cottage
at the close of the pleasant day
and cheerily called to her little son
outside the door at play
while there is light to see
to the hut of the blind old man who lives
across the dike, for me
and take these cakes i made for him
they are hot and smoking yet
you have time enough to go and come
before the sun is set

then the good-wife turned to her labor
humming a simple song
and thought of her husband, working hard
at the sluices all day long
and set the turf a-blazing
and brought the coarse black bread
that he might find a fire at night
and find the table spread

and peter left the brother
with whom all day he had played
and the sister who had watched their sports
in the willow's tender shade
and told them they'd see him back before
they saw a star in sight
though he wouldn't be afraid to go
in the very darkest night
for he was a brave, bright fellow
with eye and conscience clear
he could do whatever a boy might do
and he had not learned to fear
why, he wouldn't have robbed a bird's nest
nor brought a stork to harm
though never a law in holland
had stood to stay his arm

and now with his face all glowing
and eyes as bright as the day
with the thoughts of his pleasant errand
he trudged along the way
and soon his joyous prattle
made glad a lonesome place
alas! if only the blind old man
could have seen that happy face
yet he somehow caught the brightness
which his voice and presence lent
and he felt the sunshine come and go
as peter came and went

and now, as the day was sinking
and the winds began to rise
the mother looked from her door again
shading her anxious eyes
and saw the shadows deepen
and birds to their homes come back
but never a sign of peter
along the level track
but she said, "he will come at morning
so i need not fret nor grieve
though it isn't like my boy at all
to stay without my leave

but where was the child delaying
on the homeward way was he
across the dike while the sun was up
an hour above the sea
he was stopping now to gather flowers
now listening to the sound
as the angry waters dashed themselves
against their narrow bound
and my father tends them carefully
or they would not hold you long
you're a wicked sea," said peter
you would like to spoil our lands and homes
but our sluices keep you safe

but hark! through the noise of waters
comes a low, clear, trickling sound
and the child's face pales with terror
and his blossoms drop to the ground
he is up the bank in a moment
and, stealing through the sand
he sees a stream not yet so large
as his slender, childish hand
unused to fearful scenes
but, young as he is, he has learned to know
the dreadful thing that means
a leak in the dike! the stoutest heart
grows faint that cry to hear
and the bravest man in all the land
turns white with mortal fear
for he knows the smallest leak may grow
to a flood in a single night
and he knows the strength of the cruel sea
when loosed in its angry might

and the boy! he has seen the danger
and shouting a wild alarm
he forces back the weight of the sea
with the strength of his single arm
he listens for the joyful sound
of a footstep passing nigh
and lays his ear to the ground, to catch
the answer to his cry
and he hears the rough winds blowing
and the waters rise and fall
but never an answer comes to him
save the echo of his call

he sees no hope, no succor
his feeble voice is lost
yet what shall he do but watch and wait
though he perish at his post
so, faintly calling and crying
till the sun is under the sea
crying and moaning till the stars
come out for company
he thinks of his brother and sister
asleep in their safe warm bed
he thinks of his father and mother
of himself as dying--and dead
and of how, when the night is over
they must come and find him at last
but he never thinks he can leave the place
where duty holds him fast

the good dame in the cottage
is up and astir with the light
for the thought of her little peter
has been with her all night
and now she watches the pathway
as yester eve she had done
but what does she see so strange and black
against the rising sun
her neighbors are bearing between them
something straight to her door
her child is coming home, but not
as he ever came before

and the startled father hears
and comes and looks the way she looks
and fears the thing she fears
till a glad shout from the bearers
thrills the stricken man and wife
and god has saved his life
so, there in the morning sunshine
they knelt about the boy
and every head was bared and bent
in tearful, reverent joy

when the sea roars like a flood
their boys are taught what a boy can do
who is brave and true and good
for every man in that country
takes his son by the hand
and tells him of little peter
whose courage saved the land
they have many a valiant hero
remembered through the years
but never one whose name so oft
is named with loving tears
and his deed shall be sung by the cradle
and told to the child on the knee
so long as the dikes of holland
divide the land from the sea



merrily swinging on briar and weed
near to the nest of his little dame
over the mountain-side or mead
robert of lincoln is telling his name
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
snug and safe is that nest of ours
hidden among the summer flowers
chee, chee, chee

robert of lincoln is gaily drest
wearing a bright black wedding coat
white are his shoulders and white his crest
hear him call in his merry note
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
look, what a nice new coat is mine
sure there was never a bird so fine
chee, chee, chee

robert of lincoln's quaker wife
pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings
passing at home a patient life
broods in the grass while her husband sings
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
brood, kind creature; you need not fear
thieves and robbers while i am here
chee, chee, chee

modest and shy as a nun is she
one weak chirp is her only note
braggart and prince of braggarts is he
pouring boasts from his little throat
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
never was i afraid of man
catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can
chee, chee, chee

six white eggs on a bed of hay
flecked with purple, a pretty sight
there as the mother sits all day
robert is singing with all his might
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
nice, good wife, that never goes out
keeping the house while i frolic about
chee, chee, chee

soon as the little ones chip the shell
six wide mouths are open for food
robert of lincoln bestirs him well
gathering seeds for the hungry brood
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
this new life is likely to be
hard for a gay young fellow like me
chee, chee, chee

robert of lincoln at length is made
sober with work, and silent with care
off is his holiday garment laid
half forgotten that merry air
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
where our nest and our nestlings lie
chee, chee, chee

summer wanes; the children are grown
fun and frolic no more he knows
robert of lincoln's a humdrum crone
off he flies, and we sing as he goes
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
when you can pipe that merry old strain
robert of lincoln, come back again
chee, chee, chee



ring-ting! i wish i were a primrose
a bright yellow primrose, blowing in the spring
the stooping boughs above me
the wandering bee to love me
the fern and moss to creep across
and the elm tree for our king

nay--stay! i wish i were an elm tree
a great, lofty elm tree, with green leaves gay
the winds would set them dancing
the sun and moonshine glance in
the birds would house among the boughs
and sweetly sing

oh no! i wish i were a robin
a robin or a little wren, everywhere to go
through forest, field, or garden
and ask no leave or pardon
till winter comes with icy thumbs
to ruffle up our wing

well--tell! where should i fly to
where go to sleep in the dark wood or dell
before a day was over
home comes the rover
for mother's kiss--sweeter this
than any other thing



not a drum was heard, not a funeral note
as his corse to the rampart we hurried
not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
o'er the grave where our hero we buried

we buried him darkly at dead of night
the sods with our bayonets turning
by struggling moonbeam's misty light
and the lantern dimly burning

no useless coffin enclosed his breast
nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him
but he lay like a warrior taking his rest
with his martial cloak around him

few and short were the prayers we said
and we spoke not a word of sorrow
but we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead
and we bitterly thought of the morrow

we thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed
and smoothed down his lonely pillow
that the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head
and we far away on the billow

lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone
and o'er his cold ashes upbraid him
but little he'll reck; if they let him sleep on
in the grave where a briton has laid him

but half of our heavy task was done
when the clock tolled the hour for retiring
and we heard the distant and random gun
that the foe was sullenly firing

slowly and sadly we laid him down
from the field of his fame fresh and gory
we carved not a line, and we raised not a stone
but we left him alone with his glory



how many seconds in a minute
sixty, and no more in it

how many minutes in an hour
sixty for sun and shower

how many hours in a day
twenty-four for work and play

how many days in a week
seven both to hear and speak

how many weeks in a month
four, as the swift moon runn'th

how many months in a year
twelve, the almanack makes clear

how many years in an age
one hundred, says the sage

how many ages in time
no one knows the rhyme



here hath been dawning another blue day
think, wilt thou let it slip useless away
out of eternity this new day was born
into eternity, at night, will return
behold it aforetime no eye ever did
so soon it forever from all eyes is hid
here hath been dawning another blue day
think, wilt thou let it slip useless away



said the wind to the moon, "i will blow you out
you stare
in the air
like a ghost in a chair
always looking what i am about
i hate to be watched--i will blow you out

the wind blew hard, and out went the moon
so deep
on a heap
of clouds, to sleep
down lay the wind, and slumbered soon
muttering low, "i've done for that moon

he turned in his bed; she was there again
on high
in the sky
with her one clear eye
the moon shone white and alive and plain
said the wind--"i will blow you out again

the wind blew hard, and the moon grew dim
and my wedge
i have knocked off her edge
if only i blow right fierce and grim
the creature will soon be dimmer than dim

he blew and blew, and she thinned to a thread
more's enough
to blow her to snuff
one good puff more where the last was bred
and glimmer, glimmer, glum will go the thread

he blew a great blast, and the thread was gone
in the air
nowhere
was a moonbeam bare
far off and harmless the shy stars shone
sure and certain the moon was gone

the wind, he took to his revels once more
on down
in town
like a merry-mad clown
he leaped and halloed with whistle and roar

he flew in a rage--he danced and blew
but in vain
was the pain
of his bursting brain
for still the broader the moon-scrap grew
the broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew

slowly she grew--till she filled the night
and shone
on her throne
in the sky alone
a matchless, wonderful, silvery light
radiant and lovely, the queen of the night

with my breath
good faith
i blew her to death
first blew her away right out of the sky

but the moon, she knew nothing about the affair
for, high
in the sky
with her one white eye
motionless, miles above the air
she had never heard the great wind blare



in the heart of a seed
buried deep, so deep
a dear little plant
lay fast asleep

of the raindrop bright

the little plant heard
and it rose to see
what the wonderful
outside world might be



listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of paul revere
on the eighteenth of april, in seventy-five
hardly a man is now alive
who remembers that famous day and year

he said to his friend, "if the british march
by land or sea from the town tonight
hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
of the north church tower, as a signal light
one, if by land, and two, if by sea
and i on the opposite shore will be
ready to ride and spread the alarm
through every middlesex village and farm
for the country folk to be up and to arm

then he said, "good-night"; and with muffled oar
silently rowed to the charlestown shore
just as the moon rose over the bay
where, swinging wide at her moorings, lay
the somerset, british man-of-war
a phantom ship, with each mast and spar
across the moon like a prison bar
and a huge black hulk, that was magnified
by its own reflection in the tide

meanwhile, his friend through alley and street
wanders and watches with eager ears
till, in the silence around him, he hears
the muster of men at the barrack door
the sound of arms, and the tramp of feet
and the measured tread of the grenadiers
marching down to their boats on the shore

then he climbed to the tower of the old north church
by the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread
to the belfry chamber overhead
and startled the pigeons from their perch
on the sombre rafters, that round him made
masses and moving shapes of shade
by the trembling ladder, steep and tall
to the highest window in the wall
where he paused to listen, and look down
a moment on the roofs of the town
and the moonlight flowing over all

beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead
in their night encampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear, like a sentinel's tread
the watchful night wind, as it went
creeping along from tent to tent
and seeming to whisper, "all is well
a moment only he feels the spell
of the place and hour, and the secret dread
of the lonely belfry and the dead
for suddenly all his thoughts are bent
on a shadowy something far away
where the river widens to meet the bay
a line of black, that bends and floats
on the rising tide, like a bridge of boats

meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride
booted and spurred, with a heavy stride
on the opposite shore walked paul revere
now he patted his horse's side
now gazed on the landscape far and near
then impetuous stamped the earth
and turned and tightened his saddle girth
but mostly he watched with eager search
the belfry tower of the old north church
as it rose above the graves on the hill
lonely and spectral, and sombre and still
and lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height
a glimmer, and then a gleam of light
he springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns
but lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
a second lamp in the belfry burns

a harry of hoofs in a village street
a shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark
and beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet
that was all! and yet, through the gloom and the light
the fate of a nation was riding that night
and the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight
kindled the land into flame with its heat
he has left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep
is the mystic, meeting the ocean tides
and under the alders, that skirt its edge
now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge
is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides

it was twelve by the village clock
when he crossed the bridge into medford town
he heard the crowing of the cock
and the barking of the farmer's dog
and felt the damp of the river fog
that rises after the sun goes down

it was one by the village clock
when he galloped into lexington
he saw the gilded weathercock
swim in the moonlight as he passed
and the meeting house windows, blank and bare
gaze at him with a spectral glare
as if they already stood aghast
at the bloody work they would look upon

it was two by the village clock
when he came to the bridge in concord town
he heard the bleating of the flock
and the twittering of birds among the trees
and felt the breath of the morning breeze
blowing over the meadows brown
and one was safe and asleep in his bed
who at the bridge would be first to fall
who that day would be lying dead
pierced by a british musket ball

you know the rest. in the books you have read
how the british regulars fired and fled
how the farmers gave them ball for ball
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the red coats down the lane
then crossing the fields to emerge again
under the trees at the turn of the road
and only pausing to fire and load

so through the night rode paul revere
and so through the night went his cry of alarm
to every middlesex village and farm
a cry of defiance, and not of fear
a voice in the darkness, a knock at the door
and a word that shall echo forever-more
for borne on the night wind of the past
through all our history to the last
in the hour of darkness and peril and need
the people will waken and listen to hear
the hurrying hoof beats of that steed
and the midnight message of paul revere



in flanders fields the poppies grow
between the crosses, row on row
that mark our place; and in the sky
the larks, still bravely singing, fly
scarce heard amid the guns below

we are the dead. short days ago
we lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow
loved and were loved; and now we lie
in flanders fields

take up our quarrel with the foe
to you, from failing hands, we throw
the torch. be yours to hold it high
if ye break faith with us who die
we shall not sleep, though poppies blow
in flanders fields



in flanders fields the cannon boom
and fitful flashes light the gloom
while up above, like eagles, fly
the fierce destroyers of the sky
with stains the earth wherein you lie
is redder than the poppy bloom
in flanders fields

sleep on, ye brave. the shrieking shell
the quaking trench, the startled yell
the fury of the battle hell
shall wake you not; for all is well
sleep peacefully; for all is well

your flaming torch aloft we bear
with burning heart an oath we swear
to keep the faith, to fight it through
to crush the foe, or sleep with you
in flanders fields



the little toy dog is covered with dust
but sturdy and stanch he stands
and the little toy soldier is red with rust
and his musket moulds in his hands
time was when the little toy dog was new
and the soldier was passing fair
and that was the time when our little boy blue
kissed them and put them there

so toddling off to his trundle-bed
he dreamt of the pretty toys
and as he was dreaming, an angel song
awakened our little boy blue
oh, the years are many, the years are long
but the little toy friends are true

ay, faithful to little boy blue they stand
each in the same old place
awaiting the touch of a little hand
the smile of a little face
and they wonder, as waiting these long years through
in the dust of that little chair
what has become of our little boy blue
since he kissed them and put them there



to him who in the love of nature holds
communion with her visible forms, she speaks
a various language; for his gayer hours
she has a voice of gladness, and a smile
and eloquence of beauty, and she glides
into his darker musings with a mild
and healing sympathy, that steals away
their sharpness, ere he is aware. when thoughts
of the last bitter hoar come like a blight
over thy spirit, and sad images
of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall
and breathless darkness, and the narrow house
make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart
go forth, under the open sky, and list
to nature's teachings, while from all around
earth and her waters, and the depths of air
comes a still voice--yet a few days, and thee
the all-beholding sun shall see no more
in all his course; nor yet in the cold ground
where thy pale form was laid with many tears
nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
thy image. earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
thy growth, to be resolved to earth again
and, lost each human trace, surrendering up
thine individual being, shalt thou go
to mix forever with the elements
to be a brother to the insensible rock
and to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
turns with his share, and treads upon. the oak
shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould
yet not to thine eternal resting-place
shalt thou retire alone--nor couldst thou wish
couch more magnificent. thou shalt lie down
with patriarchs of the infant world--with kings
the powerful of the earth--the wise, the good
fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past
all in one mighty sepulchre. the hills
rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun,--the vales
stretching in pensive quietness between
the venerable woods--rivers that move
in majesty, and the complaining brooks
that make the meadows green; and, poured round all
old ocean's gray and melancholy waste
are but the solemn decorations all
of the great tomb of man. the golden sun
the planets, all the infinite host of heaven
are shining on the sad abodes of death
through the still lapse of ages. all that tread
the globe are but a handful to the tribes
that slumber in its bosom. take the wings
of morning, pierce the barcan wilderness
or lose thyself in the continuous woods
where rolls the oregon, and hears no sound
save his own dashings--yet, the dead are there
and millions in those solitudes, since first
the flight of years began, have laid them down
in their last sleep--the dead reign there alone
so shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw
in silence from the living, and no friend
take note of thy departure? all that breathe
will share thy destiny. the gay will laugh
when thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
plod on, and each one as before will chase
his favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
their mirth and their employments, and shall come
and make their bed with thee. as the long train
of ages glide away, the sons of men
the youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
in the full strength of years, matron, and maid
and the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man
shall one by one be gathered to thy side
by those who in their turn shall follow them

so live, that when thy summons comes to join
the innumerable caravan which moves
to the pale realms of shade, where each shall take
his chamber in the silent halls of death
thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night
scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed
by an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
about him, and lies down to pleasant dreams



it ain't the funniest thing a man can do
existing in a country when it's new
nature, who moved in first--a good long while
has things already somewhat her own style
and she don't want her woodland splendors battered
her rustic furniture broke up and scattered
her paintings, which long years ago were done
by that old splendid artist-king, the sun
torn down and dragged in civilization's gutter
or sold to purchase settlers' bread and butter
she don't want things exposed from porch to closet
and so she kind o' nags the man who does it
she carries in her pockets bags of seeds
as general agent of the thriftiest weeds
she sends her blackbirds, in the early morn
to superintend his fields of planted corn
she gives him rain past any duck's desire
then maybe several weeks of quiet fire
she sails mosquitoes--leeches perched on wings
to poison him with blood-devouring stings
she loves her ague-muscle to display
and shake him up--say every other day
with, thoughtful, conscientious care she makes
those travelin' poison-bottles, rattlesnakes
she finds time, 'mongst her other family cares
to keep in stock good wild-cats, wolves, and bears

well, when i first infested this retreat
things to my view looked frightful incomplete
but i had come with heart-thrift in my song
and brought my wife and plunder right along
i hadn't a round trip ticket to go back
and if i had there wasn't no railroad track
and drivin' east was what i couldn't endure
i hadn't started on a circular tour

my girl-wife was as brave as she was good
and helped me every blessed way she could
she seemed to take to every rough old tree
as sing'lar as when first she took to me
she kep' our little log-house neat as wax
and once i caught her fooling with my axe
she learned a hundred masculine things to do
she aimed a shot-gun pretty middlin' true
although in spite of my express desire
she always shut her eyes before she'd fire
she hadn't the muscle (though she _had_ the heart
in out-door work to take an active part
though in our firm of duty and endeavor
she wasn't no silent partner whatsoever
when i was logging, burning, choppin' wood
she'd linger round and help me all she could
and keep me fresh-ambitious all the while
and lifted tons just with her voice and smile
with no desire my glory for to rob
she used to stan' around and boss the job
and when first-class success my hands befell
would proudly say, "_we_ did that pretty well
she _was_ delicious, both to hear and see
that pretty wife-girl that kep' house for me

well, neighborhoods meant counties in those days
the roads didn't have accommodating ways
and maybe weeks would pass before she'd see
and much less talk with--any one but me
the indians sometimes showed their sun-baked faces
but they didn't teem with conversational graces
some ideas from the birds and trees she stole
but 'twasn't like talking with a human soul
and finally i thought that i could trace
a half heart-hunger peering from her face
then she would drive it back and shut the door
of course that only made me see it more
making a steady effort not to pine
and recognize the seeds of sorrow in it
no misery makes a close observer mourn
like hopeless grief with hopeful courage borne
there's nothing sets the sympathies to paining
like a complaining woman uncomplaining
it always draws my breath out into sighs
to see a brave look in a woman's eyes

well, she went on, as plucky as could be
fighting the foe she thought i did not see
and using her heart-horticultural powers
to turn that forest to a bed of flowers
you cannot check an unadmitted sigh
and so i had to soothe her on the sly
and secretly to help her draw her load
and soon it came to be an up-hill road
hard work bears hard upon the average pulse
even with satisfactory results
but when effects are scarce, the heavy strain
falls dead and solid on the heart and brain
and when we're bothered, it will oft occur
we seek blame-timber; and i lit on her
and looked at her with daily lessening favor
for what i knew she couldn't help, to save her
and discord, when he once had called and seen us
came round quite often, and edged in between us

one night, when i came home unusual late
too hungry and too tired to feel first-rate
her supper struck me wrong (though i'll allow
she hadn't much to strike with, anyhow
and when i went to milk the cows, and found
they'd wandered from their usual feeding ground
and maybe'd left a few long miles behind 'em
which i must copy, if i meant to find 'em
flash-quick the stay-chains of my temper broke
and in a, trice these hot words i had spoke
and drove 'em in; you'd nothing else to do
the heft of all our life on me must fall
you just lie round and let me do it all

that speech--it hadn't been gone a half a minute
before i saw the cold black poison in it
and i'd have given all i had, and more
to've only safely got it back in-door
i'm now what most folks "well-to-do" would call
i feel to-day as if i'd give it all
provided i through fifty years might reach
and kill and bury that half-minute speech

she handed back no words, as i could hear
she didn't frown; she didn't shed a tear
half proud, half crushed, she stood and looked me o'er
like some one she had never seen before
but such a sudden anguish-lit surprise
i never viewed before in human eyes
it sometimes wakes me like a midnight scream

next morning, when, stone-faced, but heavy-hearted
with dinner pail and sharpened axe i started
away for my day's work--she watched the door
and followed me half way to it or more
and i was just a-turning round at this
and asking for my usual good-by kiss
but on her lip i saw a proudish curve
and in her eye a shadow of reserve
and she had shown--perhaps half unawares
some little independent breakfast airs
and so the usual parting didn't occur
although her eyes invited me to her
or rather half invited me, for she
didn't advertise to furnish kisses free
you always had--that is, i had--to pay
full market price, and go more'n half the way
so, with a short "good-by," i shut the door
and left her as i never had before
but when at noon my lunch i came to eat
put up by her so delicately neat
choicer, somewhat, than yesterday's had been
and some fresh, sweet-eyed pansies she'd put in
it seemed as if her kiss with me she'd sent
then i became once more her humble lover
and said, "to-night i'll ask forgiveness of her

i went home over-early on that eve
having contrived to make myself believe
by various signs i kind o' knew and guessed
a thunder-storm was coming from the west
how many honest ones will take its part
a dozen first-class reasons said 'twas right
that i should strike home early on that night

half out of breath, the cabin door i swung
with tender heart-words trembling on my tongue
but all within looked desolate and bare
my house had lost its soul,--she was not there
a penciled note was on the table spread
and these are something like the words it said
i watched them pretty close; don't scold me, dear
and where they are, i think i nearly know
i heard the bell not very long ago
i've hunted for them all the afternoon
i'll try once more--i think i'll find them soon
dear, if a burden i have been to you
and haven't helped you as i ought to do
let old-time memories my forgiveness plead
i've tried to do my best--i have indeed
darling, piece out with love the strength i lack
and have kind words for me when i get back

scarce did i give this letter sight and tongue
some swift-blown rain-drops to the window clung
and from the clouds a rough, deep growl proceeded
my thunder-storm had come, now 'twasn't needed
i rushed out-door. the air was stained with black
night had come early, on the storm-cloud's back
and everything kept dimming to the sight
save when the clouds threw their electric light
when for a flash, so clean-cut was the view
i'd think i saw her--knowing 'twas not true
through my small clearing dashed wide sheets of spray
as if the ocean waves had lost their way
scarcely a pause the thunder-battle made
in the bold clamor of its cannonade
and she, while i was sheltered, dry, and warm
was somewhere in the clutches of this storm
she who, when storm-frights found her at her best
had always hid her white face on my breast

my dog, who'd skirmished round me all the day
now crouched and whimpering, in a corner lay
i dragged him by the collar to the wall
i pressed his quivering muzzle to a shawl
matched eyes with me, as if to read my mind
then with a yell went tearing through the wood
i followed him, as faithful as i could
no pleasure-trip was that, through flood and flame
we raced with death: we hunted noble game
all night we dragged the woods without avail
the ground got drenched--we could not keep the trail
three times again my cabin home i found
half hoping she might be there, safe and sound
but each time 'twas an unavailing care
my house had lost its soul; she was not there

when, climbing--the wet trees, next morning-sun
laughed at the ruin that the night had done
bleeding and drenched, by toil and sorrow bent
back to what used to be my home i went
but as i neared our little clearing-ground
listen!--i heard the cow-bell's tinkling sound
the cabin door was just a bit ajar
it gleamed upon my glad eyes like a star
she made them guide her homeward through the storm
such pangs of joy i never felt before

yes, she had come--and gone again. she lay
with all her young life crushed and wrenched away
lay, the heart-ruins of oar home among
not far from where i killed her with my tongue
the rain-drops glittered 'mid her hair's long strands
the forest thorns had torn her feet and hands
and 'midst the tears--brave tears--that one could trace
upon the pale but sweetly resolute face
i once again the mournful words could read

and now i'm mostly done; my story's o'er
part of it never breathed the air before
to volunteer heart-history to a crowd
and scatter 'mongst them confidential tears
but you'll protect an old man with his years
and wheresoe'er this story's voice can reach
this is the sermon i would have it preach

boys flying kites haul in their white-winged birds
you can't do that way when you're flying words
thoughts unexpressed may sometimes fall back dead
but god himself can't kill them when they're said
yon have my life-grief: do not think a minute
it sheds advice: whoe'er will take and live it
is welcome to the pain it cost to give it



i ain't afeard uv snakes, or toads, or bugs, or worms, or mice
an' things 'at girls are skeered uv i think are awful nice
i'm pretty brave, i guess; an' yet i hate to go to bed
for, when i'm tucked up warm an' snug an' when my prayers are said
mother tells me "happy dreams!" and takes away the light
an' leaves me lying all alone an' seein' things at night

sometimes they're in the corner, sometimes they're by the door
sometimes they're all a-standin' in the middle uv the floor
sometimes they are a-sittin' down, sometimes they're walkin' round
so softly an' so creepylike they never make a sound
sometimes they are as black as ink, an' other times they're white
but the color ain't no difference when you see things at night

once, when i licked a feller 'at had just moved on our street
an' father sent me up to bed without a bite to eat
i woke up in the dark an' saw things standin' in a row
a-lookin' at me cross-eyed an' p'intin' at me--so
oh, my! i was so skeered that time i never slep' a mite
it's almost alluz when i'm bad i see things at night

lucky thing i ain't a girl, or i'd be skeered to death
bein' i'm a boy, i duck my head an' hold my breath
an' i am, oh! so sorry i'm a naughty boy, an' then
i promise to be better an' i say my prayers again
gran'ma tells me that's the only way to make it right
when a feller has been wicked an' sees things at night

an' so, when other naughty boys would coax me into sin
i try to skwush the tempter's voice 'at urges me within
an' when they's pie for supper, or cakes 'at's big an' nice
i want to--but i do not pass my plate f'r them things twice
no, ruther let starvation wipe me slowly out o' sight
than i should keep a-livin' on an' seein' things at night

maud muller, on a summer's day
raked the meadow sweet with hay

beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth
of simple beauty and rustic health

singing, she wrought, and her merry glee
the mock-bird echoed from his tree

but when she glanced to the far-off town
white from its hill-slope looking down

the sweet song died, and a vague unrest
and a nameless longing filled her breast

a wish, that she hardly dared to own
for something better than she had known

the judge rode slowly down the lane
smoothing his horse's chestnut mane

he drew his bridle in the shade
of the apple-trees, to greet the maid

and asked a draught from the spring that flowed
through the meadow across the road

she stooped where the cool spring bubbled up
and filled for him her small tin cup

and blushed as she gave it, looking down
on her feet so bare, and her tattered gown

from a fairer hand was never quaffed

he spoke of the grass and flowers and trees
of the singing birds and the humming' bees

then talked of the haying, and wondered whether
the cloud in the west would bring foul weather

and maud forgot her brier-torn gown
and her graceful ankles bare and brown

and listened, while a pleased surprise
looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes

at last, like one who for delay
seeks a vain excuse, he rode away

maud muller looked and sighed: "ah, me
that i the judge's bride might be

and praise and toast me at his wine

my brother should sail a painted boat

and the baby should have a new toy each day

and all should bless me who left our door

the judge looked back as he climbed the hill
and saw maud muller standing still

ne'er hath it been my lot to meet

show her wise and good as she is fair

like her, a harvester of hay

nor weary lawyers with endless tongues

and health and quiet and loving words

but he thought of his sisters proud and cold
and his mother vain of her rank and gold

so, closing his heart, the judge rode on
and maud was left in the field alone

but the lawyers smiled that afternoon
when he hummed in court an old love-tune

and the young girl mused beside the well
till the rain on the unraked clover fell

he wedded a wife of richest dower
who lived for fashion, as he for power

yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow
he watched a picture come and go

and sweet maud muller's hazel eyes
looked out in their innocent surprise

oft, when the wine in his glass was red
he longed for the wayside well instead

and closed his eyes on his garnished rooms
to dream of meadows and clover-blooms

and the proud man sighed, with a secret pain

where the barefoot maiden raked her hay

she wedded a man unlearned and poor
and many children played round her door

but care and sorrow, and childbirth pain
left their traces on heart and brain

and oft, when the summer sun shone hot
on the new-mown hay in the meadow lot

and she heard the little spring brook fall
over the roadside, through the wall

in the shade of the apple-tree again
she saw a rider draw his rein

and, gazing down with timid grace
she felt his pleased eyes read her face

sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
stretched away into stately halls

the weary wheel to a spinnet turned
the tallow candle an astral burned

and for him who sat by the chimney lug
dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug

a manly form at her side she saw
and joy was duty and love was law

then she took up her burden of life again
saying only, "it might have been

alas for maiden, alas for judge
for rich repiner and household drudge

god pity them both! and pity us all
who vainly the dreams of youth recall

for of all sad words of tongue or pen
the saddest are these: "it might have been

ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies
deeply buried from human eyes

and, in the hereafter, angels may
roll the stone from its grave away



we were hunting for wintergreen berries
one may-day, long gone by
out on the rocky cliff's edge
sister had hair like the sunbeams
black as a crow's wing, mine
sister had blue, dove's eyes
wicked, black eyes are mine
why, see how my eyes are faded
and my hair, it is white as snow
and thin, too! don't you see it is
i tear it sometimes; so
there, don't hold my hands, maggie
i don't feel like tearing it now
but--where was i in my story
oh, i was telling you how
we were looking for wintergreen berries
and the moss-grown rocks were slippery
with the rains of yesterday
but i was cross that morning
though the sun shone ever so bright
and when sister found the most berries
i was angry enough to fight
and when she laughed at my pouting
we were little things, you know
i clinched my little fist up tight
and struck her the biggest blow
i struck her--i tell you--i struck her
and she fell right over below
there, there, maggie, i won't rave now
you needn't hold me so
she went right over, i tell you
down, down to the depths below
there where the waters flow
she fell right over, moaning
that, when i looked down affrighted
it drove me _mad--mad
only her golden hair streaming
out on the rippling wave
only her little hand reaching
up, for someone to save
and she sank down in the darkness
i never saw her again
and this is a chaos of blackness
and darkness and grief since then
no more playing together
down on the pebbly strand
nor building our dolls stone castles
with halls and parlors grand
no more fishing with bent pins
in the little brook's clear waves
no more holding funerals
o'er dead canaries' graves
no more walking together
to the log schoolhouse each morn
no more vexing the master
with putting his rules to scorn
no more feeding of white lambs
with milk from the foaming pail
no more playing "see-saw
over the fence of rail
no more telling of stories
after we've gone to bed
nor talking of ghosts and goblins
till we fairly shiver with dread
no more whispering fearfully
and hugging each other tight
when the shutters shake and the dogs howl
in the middle of the night
no more saying "our father
kneeling by mother's knee
for, maggie, i _struck_ sister
and mother is dead, you see
maggie, sister's an angel
isn't she? isn't it true
for angels have golden tresses
and eyes like sister's, blue
now _my_ hair isn't golden
my eyes aren't blue, you see
now tell me, maggie, if i were to die
could they make an angel of me
you say, "oh, yes"; you think so
well, then, when i come to die
we'll play up there, in god's garden
now, maggie, you needn't eye me
because i'm talking so queer
because i'm talking so strangely
you needn't have the least fear
somehow i'm feeling to-night, maggie
as i never felt before
i'm sure, i'm sure of it, maggie
i never shall rave any more
maggie, you know how these long years
i've heard her calling, so sad
it always drives me _mad
how the winter wind shrieks down the chimney
how the south wind wails at the casement
but most of all when the may-days
come back, with the flowers and the sun
how the night-bird, singing, all lonely
you know how it sets me raving
for _she_ moaned, "_oh, bessie!_" just so
that time i _struck_ little sister
on the may-day long ago
now, maggie, i've something to tell you
you know may-day is here
well, this very morning, at sunrise
the robins chirped "bessie!" so clear
all day long the wee birds singing
perched on the garden wall
called "bessie, oh, bessie!" so sweetly
i couldn't feel sorry at all
now, maggie, i've something to tell you
let me lean up to you close
do you see how the sunset has flooded
the heavens with yellow and rose
do you see o'er the gilded cloud mountains
sister's golden hair streaming out
do you see her little hand beckoning
do you hear her little voice calling out
yes, sister, i'm coming; i'm coming
to play in god's garden at last


it takes a heap o' livin' in a house t' make it home
a heap o' sun an' shadder, an' ye sometimes have t' roam
afore ye really 'preciate the things ye left behind
an' hunger fer 'em somehow, with 'em allus on yer mind
it don't make any differunce how rich ye get t' be
how much yer chairs an' tables cost, how great yer luxury
it ain't home t' ye, though it be the palace of a king
until somehow yer soul is sort o' wrapped 'round everything

home ain't a place that gold can buy or get up in a minute
afore it's home there's got t' be a heap o' livin' in it
within the walls there's got t' be some babies born, and then
right there ye've got t' bring 'em up t' women good, an' men
and gradjerly, as time goes on ye find ye wouldn't part
with anything they ever used--they've grown into yer heart
the old high chairs, the playthings, too, the little shoes they wore
ye hoard; an' if ye could ye'd keep the thumbmarks on the door

ye've got t' weep t' make it home, ye've got t' sit and sigh
an' watch beside a loved one's bed, an' know that death is nigh
an' in the stillness o' the night t' see death's angel come
an' close the eyes o' her that smiled, an' leave her sweet voice dumb
fer these are scenes that grip the heart, an' when yer tears are dried
ye find the home is dearer than it was, an' sanctified
an' tuggin' at ye always are the pleasant memories
o' her that was an' is no more--ye can't escape from these

ye've got t' sing and dance fer years, ye've got t' romp an' play
an' learn t' love the things ye have by usin' 'em each day
even the roses 'round the porch must blossom year by year
afore they 'come a part o' ye, suggestin' someone dear
who used t' love 'em long ago, an' trained 'em jes' t' run
the way they do, so's they would get the early mornin' sun
ye've got t' love each brick an' stone from cellar up t' dome
it takes a heap o' livin' in a house f' make it home



whenever i walk to suffern along the erie track
i go by a poor old farm-house with its shingles broken and black
i suppose i've passed it a hundred times, but i always stop for a minute
and look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it

i've never seen a haunted house, but i hear there are such things
that they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings
i know that house isn't haunted and i wish it were, i do
for it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two

this house on the road to suffern needs a dozen panes of glass
and somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass
it needs new paint and shingles and vines should be trimmed and tied
but what it needs most of all is some people living inside

if i had a bit of money and all my debts were paid
i'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade
i'd buy that place and fix it up the way that it used to be
and i'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free

now a new home standing empty with staring window and door
looks idle perhaps and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store
but there's nothing mournful about it, it cannot be sad and lone
for the lack of something within it that it has never known

but a house that has done what a house should do, a house that has
sheltered life
that has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife
a house that has echoed a baby's laugh and helped up his stumbling feet
is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet

so whenever i go to suffern along the erie track
i never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back
yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen
apart
for i can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken
heart



like liquid gold the wheat field lies
a marvel of yellow and russet and green
that ripples and runs, that floats and flies
with the subtle shadows, the change, the sheen
that play in the golden hair of a girl
a ripple of amber--a flare
of light sweeping after--a curl
in the hollows like swirling feet
of fairy waltzers, the colors run
to the western sun
through the deeps of the ripening wheat

broad as the fleckless, soaring sky
mysterious, fair as the moon-led sea
the vast plain flames on the dazzled eye
under the fierce sun's alchemy
the slow hawk stoops
to his prey in the deeps
the sunflower droops
to the lazy wave; the wind sleeps
then swirling in dazzling links and loops
a riot of shadow and shine
a glory of olive and amber and wine
to the westering sun the colors run
through the deeps of the ripening wheat

o glorious land! my western land
outspread beneath the setting sun
once more amid your swells, i stand
and cross your sod-lands dry and dun
i hear the jocund calls of men
who sweep amid the ripened grain
with swift, stern reapers; once again
the evening splendor floods the plain
the crickets' chime
makes pauseless rhyme
and toward the sun
the colors run
before the wind's feet
in the wheat



i walked through the woodland meadows
where sweet the thrushes sing
and i found on a bed of mosses
a bird with a broken wing
i healed its wound, and each morning
it sang its old sweet strain
but the bird with a broken pinion
never soared as high again

i found a young life broken
by sin's seductive art
and touched with a christlike pity
i took him to my heart
he lived with a noble purpose
and struggled not in vain
but the life that sin had stricken
never soared as high again

but the bird with a broken pinion
kept another from the snare
and the life that sin had stricken
raised another from despair
each loss has its compensation
there is healing for every pain
but the bird with a broken pinion
never soars as high again



it was in the days when claverhouse
was scouring moor and glen
to change, with fire and bloody sword
the faith of scottish men

they had made a covenant with the lord
firm in their faith to bide
nor break to him their plighted word
whatever might betide

the sun was well-nigh setting
when o'er the heather wild
and up the narrow mountain-path
alone there walked a child

he was a bonny, blithesome lad
sturdy and strong of limb
a father's pride, a mother's love
were fast bound up in him

his bright blue eyes glanced fearless round
his step was firm and light
what was it underneath his plaid
his little hands grasped tight

it was bannocks which, that very morn
his mother made with care
from out her scanty store of meal
and now, with many a prayer

had sent by jamie her ane boy
a trusty lad and brave
to good old pastor tammons roy
now hid in yonder cave

and for whom the bloody claverhouse
had hunted long in vain
and swore they would not leave that glen
till old tam roy was slain

so jamie douglas went his way
with heart that knew no fear
he turned the great curve in the rock
nor dreamed that death was near

and there were bloody claverhouse men
who laughed aloud with glee
when trembling now within their power
the frightened child they see

he turns to flee, but all in vain
they drag him back apace
to where their cruel leader stands
and set them face to face

the cakes concealed beneath his plaid
soon tell the story plain
exclaimed the angry man

and i will let you go
but jamie shook his yellow curls
and stoutly answered--"no

and there upon the stones
the old gaunt wolf and carrion crow
shall battle for your bones

and in his brawny, strong right hand
he lifted up the child
and held him where the clefted rocks
formed a chasm deep and wild

so deep it was, the trees below
like stunted bushes seemed
poor jamie looked in frightened maze
it seemed some horrid dream

he looked up at the blue sky above
then at the men near by
had _they_ no little boys at home
that they could let him die

but no one spoke and no one stirred
or lifted hand to save
from such a fearful, frightful death
the little lad so brave

so drop me down then, if you will
it is nae so deep as hell

a childish scream, a faint, dull sound
oh! jamie douglas true
long, long within that lonely cave
shall tam roy wait for you

long for your welcome coming
waits the mother on the moor
and watches and calls, "come, jamie, lad
through the half-open door

no more adown the rocky path
you come with fearless tread
or, on moor or mountain, take
the good man's daily bread

but up in heaven the shining ones
a wondrous story tell
of a child snatched up from a rocky gulf
that is nae so deep as hell

and there before the great white throne
forever blessed and glad
his mother dear and old tam roy
shall meet their bonny lad


never mind me, uncle jared, never mind my bleeding breast
they are charging in the valley and you're needed with the rest
all the day long from its dawning till you saw your kinsman fall
you have answered fresh and fearless to our brave commander's call
and i would not rob my country of your gallant aid to-night
though your presence and your pity stay my spirit in its flight

all along that quivering column see the death steed trampling down
men whose deeds this day are worthy of a kingdom and a crown
prithee hasten, uncle jared, what's the bullet in my breast
to that murderous storm of fire raining tortures on the rest
see! the bayonets flash and falter--look! the foe begins to win
see! oh, see our falling comrades! god! the ranks are closing in

hark! there's quickening in the distance and a thundering in the air
like the roaring of a lion just emerging from his lair
there's a cloud of something yonder fast unrolling like a scroll
quick! oh, quick! if it be succor that can save the cause a soul
look! a thousand thirsty bayonets are flashing down the vale
and a thousand thirsty riders dashing onward like a gale

raise me higher, uncle jared, place the ensign in my hand
i am strong enough to float it while you cheer that flying band
louder! louder! shout for freedom with prolonged and vigorous breath
shout for liberty and union, and the victory over death
see! they catch the stirring numbers and they swell them to the breeze
cap and plume and starry banner waving proudly through the trees

mark our fainting comrades rally, see that drooping column rise
i can almost see the fire newly kindled in their eyes
fresh for conflict, nerved to conquer, see them charging on the foe
face to face with deadly meaning--shot and shell and trusty blow
see the thinned ranks wildly breaking--see them scatter to the sun
i can die, uncle jared, for the glorious day is won

but there's something, something pressing with a numbness on my heart
and my lips with mortal dumbness fail the burden to impart
oh i tell you, uncle jared, there is something back of all
that a soldier cannot part with when he heeds his country's call
ask the mother what, in dying, sends her yearning spirit back
over life's rough, broken marches, where she's pointed out the track

ask the dear ones gathered nightly round the shining household hearth
what to them is dearer, better, than the brightest things of earth
ask that dearer one whose loving, like a ceaseless vestal flame
sets my very soul a-glowing at the mention of her name
ask her why the loved in dying feels her spirit linked with his
in a union death but strengthens, she will tell you what it is

and there's something, uncle jared, you may tell her if you will
that the precious flag she gave me, i have kept unsullied still
and--this touch of pride forgive me--where death sought our gallant host
where our stricken lines were weakest, there it ever waved the most
bear it back and tell her fondly, brighter, purer, steadier far

but forbear, dear uncle jared, when there's something more to tell
when her lips with rapid blanching bid you answer how i fell
teach your tongue the trick of slighting, though 'tis faithful to the rest
lest it say her brother's bullet is the bullet in my breast
but if it must be that she learn it despite your tenderest care

life is ebbing, uncle jared, my enlistment endeth here
death, the conqueror, has drafted--i can no more volunteer
but i hear the roll call yonder and i go with willing feet
through the shadows of the valley where victorious armies meet
raise the ensign, uncle jared, let its dear folds o'er me fall
strength and union for my country--and god's banner over all


every coin of earthly treasure
we have lavished upon earth
for our simple worldly pleasure
may be reckoned something worth
for the spending was not losing
tho' the purchase were but small
it has perished with the using
we have had it,--that is all

all the gold we leave behind us
when we turn to dust again
tho' our avarice may blind us
we have gathered quite in vain
since we neither can direct it
by the winds of fortune tost
nor in other worlds expect it
what we hoarded we have lost

but each merciful oblation
seed of pity wisely sown
what we gave in self-negation
we may safely call our own
for the treasure freely given
is the treasure that we hoard
since the angels keep in heaven
what is lent unto the lord



whence come those shrieks so wild and shrill
that cut, like blades of steel, the air
causing the creeping blood to chill
with the sharp cadence of despair

again they come, as if a heart
were cleft in twain by one quick blow
and every string had voice apart
to utter its peculiar woe

whence came they? from yon temple, where
an altar, raised for private prayer
now forms the warrior's marble bed
who warsaw's gallant armies led

the dim funereal tapers throw
a holy luster o'er his brow
and burnish with their rays of light
the mass of curls that gather bright
above the haughty brow and eye
of a young boy that's kneeling by

what hand is that, whose icy press
clings to the dead with death's own grasp
but meets no answering caress
no thrilling fingers seek its clasp
it is the hand of her whose cry
rang wildly, late, upon the air
when the dead warrior met her eye
outstretched upon the altar there

with pallid lip and stony brow
she murmurs forth her anguish now
but hark! the tramp of heavy feet
is heard along the bloody street
nearer and nearer yet they come
with clanking arms and noiseless drum
now whispered curses, low and deep
around the holy temple creep
the gate is burst; a ruffian band
rush in, and savagely demand
with brutal voice and oath profane
the startled boy for exile's chain

the mother sprang with gesture wild
and to her bosom clasped her child
then, with pale cheek and flashing eye
shouted with fearful energy
too near the body of my dead
nor touch the living boy; i stand
between him and your lawless band
take _me_, and bind these arms--these hands
with russia's heaviest iron bands
and drag me to siberia's wild
to perish, if 'twill save my child

tearing the pale boy from her side
and in his ruffian grasp he bore
his victim to the temple door
will land or gold redeem my son
take heritage, take name, take all
but leave him free from russian thrall
take these!" and her white arms and hands
she stripped of rings and diamond bands
and tore from braids of long black hair
the gems that gleamed like starlight there
her cross of blazing rubies, last
down at the russian's feet she cast
he stooped to seize the glittering store
up springing from the marble floor
the mother, with a cry of joy
snatched to her leaping heart the boy
but no! the russian's iron grasp
again undid the mother's clasp
forward she fell, with one long cry
of more than mortal agony

but the brave child is roused at length
and, breaking from the russian's hold
he stands, a giant in the strength
of his young spirit, fierce and bold
proudly he towers; his flashing eye
so blue, and yet so bright
seems kindled from the eternal sky
so brilliant is its light

his curling lips and crimson cheeks
foretell the thought before he speaks
with a full voice of proud command
he turned upon the wondering band

this hour has made the boy a man
i knelt before my slaughtered sire
nor felt one throb of vengeful ire
i wept upon his marble brow
yes, wept! i was a child; but now
my noble mother, on her knee
hath done the work of years for me

he drew aside his broidered vest
and there, like slumbering serpent's crest
the jeweled haft of poniard bright
glittered a moment on the sight
think ye my noble father's glaive
would drink the life-blood of a slave
the pearls that on the handle flame
would blush to rubies in their shame
the blade would quiver in thy breast
ashamed of such ignoble rest
no! thus i rend the tyrant's chain
and fling him back a boy's disdain

a moment, and the funeral light
flashed on the jeweled weapon bright
another, and his young heart's blood
leaped to the floor, a crimson flood
quick to his mother's side he sprang
and on the air his clear voice rang
the choice was death or slavery
up, mother, up! look on thy son
his freedom is forever won
and now he waits one holy kiss
to bear his father home in bliss
one last embrace, one blessing,--one
to prove thou knowest, approvest thy son
what! silent yet? canst thou not feel
my warm blood o'er thy heart congeal
speak, mother, speak! lift up thy head
what! silent still? then art thou dead
rejoice with thee,--and thus--to die
one long, deep breath, and his pale head
lay on his mother's bosom,--dead



i wrote some lines once on a time
in wondrous merry mood
and thought, as usual, men would say
they were exceeding good

they were so queer, so very queer
i laughed as i would die
albeit, in the general way

i called my servant, and he came
how kind it was of him
to mind a slender man like me
he of the mighty limb

and, in my humorous way
i added (as a trifling jest

he took the paper, and i watched
and saw him peep within
at the first line he read, his face
was all upon the grin

he read the next; the grin grew broad
and shot from ear to ear
he read the third; a chuckling noise
i now began to hear

the fourth; he broke into a roar
the fifth; his waistband split
the sixth; he burst five buttons off
and tumbled in a fit

ten days and nights, with sleepless eye
i watched that wretched man
and since, i never dare to write
as funny as i can



the shades of night were falling fast
as through an alpine village passed
a youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice
a banner with the strange device
excelsior

his brow was sad his eye beneath
flashed like a falchion from its sheath
and like a silver clarion rung
the accents of that unknown tongue
excelsior

in happy homes he saw the light
of household fires gleam warm and bright
above, the spectral glaciers shone
and from his lips escaped a groan
excelsior

the roaring torrent is deep and wide
and loud the clarion voice replied
excelsior

thy weary head upon this breast
a tear stood in his bright blue eye
but still he answered, with a sigh
excelsior

beware the awful avalanche
this was the peasant's last good-night
a voice replied, far up the height
excelsior

at break of day, as heavenward
the pious monks of saint bernard
uttered the oft-repeated prayer
a voice cried through the startled air
excelsior

a traveller, by the faithful hound
half-buried in the snow was found
still grasping in his hand of ice
that banner with the strange device
excelsior

there in the twilight cold and gray
lifeless, but beautiful, he lay
and from the sky, serene and far
a voice fell, like a falling star
excelsior



the muffled drum's sad roll has beat
the soldier's last tattoo
no more on life's parade shall meet
that brave and fallen few
on fame's eternal camping ground
their silent tents are spread
and glory guards with solemn round
the bivouac of the dead

no rumor of the foe's advance
now swells upon the wind
no troubled thought at midnight haunts
of loved ones left behind
no vision of the morrow's strife
the warrior's dream alarms
no braying horn or screaming fife
at dawn shall call to arms

their shivered swords are red with rust
their plumèd heads are bowed
their haughty banner, trailed in dust
is now their martial shroud
and plenteous funeral tears have washed
the red stains from each brow
and the proud forms, by battle gashed
are free from anguish now

the neighing troop, the flashing blade
the bugle's stirring blast
the charge, the dreadful cannonade
the din and shout are passed
nor war's wild note, nor glory's peal
shall thrill with fierce delight
those breasts that nevermore shall feel
the rapture of the fight

like a fierce northern hurricane
that sweeps his great plateau
flushed with the triumph yet to gain
came down the serried foe
who heard the thunder of the fray
break o'er the field beneath
knew well the watchword of that day
was "victory or death

full many a mother's breath hath swept
o'er angostura's plain
and long the pitying sky hath wept
above its moulder'd slain
the raven's scream, or eagle's flight
or shepherd's pensive lay
alone now wake each solemn height
that frowned o'er that dread fray

sons of the "dark and bloody ground
ye must not slumber there
where stranger steps and tongues resound
along the heedless air
your own proud land's heroic soil
shall be your fitter grave
she claims from war its richest spoil
the ashes of her brave

thus 'neath their parent turf they rest
far from the gory field
borne to a spartan mother's breast
on many a bloody shield
the sunshine of their native sky
smiles sadly on them here
and kindred eyes and hearts watch by
the heroes' sepulcher

rest on, embalmed and sainted dead
dear as the blood ye gave
no impious footsteps here shall tread
the herbage of your grave
nor shall your glory be forgot
while fame her record keeps
or honor points the hallowed spot
where valor proudly sleeps

yon marble minstrel's voiceless stone
in deathless song shall tell
when many a vanished year hath flown
the story how ye fell
nor wreck, nor change, nor winter's blight
nor time's remorseless doom
can dim one ray of holy light
that gilds your glorious tomb



come to me, o ye children
for i hear you at your play
and the questions that perplexed me
have vanished quite away

ye open the eastern windows
that look towards the sun
where thoughts are singing swallows
and the brooks of morning run

in your hearts are the birds and the sunshine
in your thoughts the brooklet's flow
but in mine is the wind of autumn
and the first fall of the snow

ah! what would the world be to us
if the children were no more
we should dread the desert behind us
worse than the dark before

what the leaves are to the forest
with light and air for food
ere their sweet and tender juices
have been hardened into wood

that to the world are children
through them it feels the glow
of a brighter and sunnier climate
than reaches the trunks below

come to me, o ye children
and whisper in my ear
what the birds and the winds are singing
in your sunny atmosphere

for what are all our contrivings
and the wisdom of our books
when compared with your caresses
and the gladness of your looks

ye are better than all the ballads
that ever were sung or said
for ye are living poems
and all the rest are dead




there was a sound of revelry by night
and belgium's capital had gathered then
her beauty and her chivalry, and bright
the lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men
a thousand hearts beat happily; and when
music arose with its voluptuous swell
soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again
and all went merry as a marriage bell
but hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell

did ye not hear it?--no; 'twas but the wind
or the car rattling o'er the stony street
on with the dance! let joy be unconfined
no sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet
to chase the glowing hours with flying feet
but, hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more
as if the clouds its echo would repeat
and nearer, clearer, deadlier than before
arm! arm! it is--it is the cannon's opening roar

ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro
and gathering tears, and tremblings of distress
and cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
blush'd at the praise of their own loveliness
and there were sudden partings, such as press
the life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
which ne'er might be repeated: who could guess
if ever more should meet those mutual eyes
since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise

and there was mounting in hot haste: the steed
the mustering squadron, and the clattering car
went pouring forward with impetuous speed
and swiftly forming in the ranks of war
and the deep thunder, peal on peal afar
and near, the beat of the alarming drum
roused up the soldier ere the morning star
while thronged the citizens with terror dumb
or whispering with white lips, "the foe! they come! they come

last noon beheld them full of lusty life
last eve in beauty's circle proudly gay
the midnight brought the signal sound of strife
the morn the marshaling in arms,--the day
battle's magnificently stern array
the thunder clouds close o'er it, which when rent
the earth is covered thick with other clay
which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent
rider and horse--friend, foe--in one red burial blent



this is the land where hate should die
no feuds of faith, no spleen of race
no darkly brooding fear should try
beneath our flag to find a place
lo! every people here has sent
its sons to answer freedom's call
their lifeblood is the strong cement
that builds and binds the nation's wall

this is the land where hate should die
though dear to me my faith and shrine
respect the creeds that are not mine
he little loves his land who'd cast
upon his neighbor's word a doubt
or cite the wrongs of ages past
from present rights to bar him out

this is the land where hate should die
this is the land where strife should cease
where foul, suspicious fear should fly
before the light of love and peace
then let us purge from poisoned thought
that service to the state we give
and so be worthy as we ought
of this great land in which we live



and its organ was the finest and the biggest in the town
and the chorus--all the papers favorably commented on it
for 'twas said each female member had a forty-dollar bonnet

now in the "amen corner" of the church sat brother eyer
who persisted every sabbath-day in singing with the choir
he was poor but genteel-looking, and his heart as snow was white
and his old face beamed with sweetness when he sang with all his might

his voice was cracked and broken, age had touched his vocal chords
and nearly every sunday he would mispronounce the words
of the hymns, and 'twas no wonder, he was old and nearly blind
and the choir rattling onward always left him far behind

the chorus stormed and blustered, brother eyer sang too slow
and then he used the tunes in vogue a hundred years ago
at last the storm-cloud burst, and the  church was told, in fine
that the brother must stop singing, or the choir would resign

then the pastor called together in the vestry-room one day
seven influential members who subscribe more than they pay
and having asked god's guidance in a printed pray'r or two
they put their heads together to determine what to do

they debated, thought, suggested, till at last "dear brother york
who last winter made a million on a sudden rise in pork
rose and moved that a committee wait at once on brother eyer
and proceed to rake him lively "for disturbin' of the choir

said he: "in that 'ere organ i've invested quite a pile
and we'll sell it if we cannot worship in the latest style
our philadelphy tenor tells me 'tis the hardest thing
fer to make god understand him when the brother tries to sing

we pay the steepest sal'ry to our pastor, brother brown
but if we must humor ignorance because it's blind and old
if the choir's to be pestered, i will seek another fold

of course the motion carried, and one day a coach and four
with the latest style of driver, rattled up to eyer's door
and the sleek, well-dress'd committee, brothers sharkey, york and lamb
as they crossed the humble portal took good care to miss the jamb

they found the choir's great trouble sitting in his old arm chair
and the summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his thin white hair
he was singing "rock of ages" in a cracked voice and low
but the angels understood him, 'twas all he cared to know

said york: "we're here, dear brother, with the vestry's approbation
to discuss a little matter that affects the congregation

that it was to relieve us, that is, do the singing for us
if we rupture the agreement, it is very plain, dear brother
it will leave our congregation and be gobbled by another

the latest tunes are all the rage; the old ones stand for naught
and so we have decided--are you list'ning, brother eyer
that you'll have to stop your singin' for it flurrytates the choir

the old man slowly raised his head, a sign that he did hear
and on his cheek the trio caught the glitter of a tear
his feeble hands pushed back the locks white as the silky snow
as he answered the committee in a voice both sweet and low

i'm sorry i disturb the choir, perhaps i'm doing wrong
but when my heart is filled with praise, i can't keep back a song

in the far-off heav'nly temple, where the master i shall greet
yes, i wonder when i try to sing the songs of god up high'r
if the angel band will church me for disturbing heaven's choir

a silence filled the little room; the old man bowed his head
the carriage rattled on again, but brother eyer was dead
yes, dead! his hand had raised the veil the future hangs before us
and the master dear had called him to the everlasting chorus

the choir missed him for a while, but he was soon forgot
a few church-goers watched the door; the old man entered not
far away, his voice no longer cracked, he sang his heart's desires
where there are no church committees and no fashionable choirs



the sweetest lives are those to duty wed
whose deeds, both great and small
are close knit strands of an unbroken thread
whose love ennobles all
the world may sound no trumpet, ring no bells
the book of life, the shining record tells
thy love shall chant its own beatitudes
after its own life-working. a child's kiss
set on thy singing lips shall make thee glad
a poor man served by thee shall make thee rich
a sick man helped by thee shall make thee strong
thou shalt be served thyself by every sense
of service thou renderest



i saw him once before
as he passed by the door
and again
the pavement stones resound
as he totters o'er the ground
with his cane

they say that in his prime
ere the pruning-knife of time
cut him down
not a better man was found
by the crier on his round
through the town

but now he walks the streets
and he looks at all he meets
sad and wan
and he shakes his feeble head
that it seems as if he said

the mossy marbles rest
on the lips that he has prest
in their bloom
and the names he loved to hear
have been carved for many a year
on the tomb

my grandmamma has said
poor old lady, she is dead
long ago
that he had a roman nose
and his cheek was like a rose
in the snow

but now his nose is thin
and it rests upon his chin
like a staff
and a crook is in his back
and a melancholy crack
in his laugh

i know it is a sin
for me to sit and grin
at him here
but the old three-cornered hat
and the breeches, and all that
are so queer

and if i should live to be
the last leaf upon the tree
in the spring
let them smile, as i do now
at the old forsaken bough
where i cling



she's up there--old glory--where lightnings are sped
she dazzles the nations with ripples of red
and she'll wave for us living, or droop o'er us dead
the flag of our country forever

she's up there--old glory--how bright the stars stream
and the stripes like red signals of liberty gleam
and we dare for her, living, or dream the last dream

she's up there--old glory--no tyrant-dealt scars
no blur on her brightness, no stain on her stars
the brave blood of heroes hath crimsoned her bars
she's the flag of our country forever



the melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year
of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sear
heaped in the hollows of the grove, the withered leaves lie dead
they rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's tread
the robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrub the jay
and from the wood-top calls the crow, through all the gloomy day

where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately sprang and stood
in brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood
alas! they all are in their graves; the gentle race of flowers
are lying in their lowly beds, with the fair and good of ours
the rain is falling where they lie; but the cold november rain
calls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again

the wind-flower and the violet, they perished long ago
and the brier-rose and the orchis died amid the summer glow
but on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood
and the yellow sun-flower by the brook, in autumn beauty stood
till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague on men
and the brightness of their smile was gone from upland, glade and glen

and now, when comes the calm, mild day, as still such days will come
to call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home
when the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still
and twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill
the south wind searches for the flowers, whose fragrance late he bore
and sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more

and then i think of one who in her youthful beauty died
the fair, meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side
in the cold, moist earth we laid her when the forest cast the leaf
and we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief
yet not unmeet it was that one, like that young friend of ours
so gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers



the rich man's son inherits lands
and piles of brick, and stone, and gold
and he inherits soft white hands
and tender flesh that fears the cold
nor dares to wear a garment old
a heritage, it seems to me
one scarce would wish to hold in fee

the rich man's son inherits cares
the bank may break, the factory burn
a breath may burst his bubble shares
and soft white hands could hardly earn
a living that would serve his turn
a heritage, it seems to me
one scarce would wish to hold in fee

the rich man's son inherits wants
his stomach craves for dainty fare
with sated heart, he hears the pants
of toiling hinds with brown arms bare
and wearies in his easy-chair
a heritage, it seems to me
one scarce would wish to hold in fee

what doth the poor man's son inherit
stout muscles and a sinewy heart
a hardy frame, a hardier spirit
king of two hands, he does his part
in every useful toil and art
a heritage, it seems to me
a king might wish to hold in fee

what doth the poor man's son inherit
wishes o'erjoyed with humble things
a rank, adjudged by toil-won merit
content that from employment springs
a heart that in his labor sings
a heritage, it seems to me
a king might wish to hold in fee

what doth the poor man's son inherit
a patience learned of being poor
courage, if sorrow come, to bear it
a fellow-feeling that is sure
to make the outcast bless his door
a heritage, it seems to me
a king might wish to hold in fee

o rich man's son! there is a toil
that with all others level stands
large charity doth never soil
but only whiten, soft white hands
this is the best crop from thy lands
a heritage it seems to me
worth being rich to hold in fee

o poor man's son! scorn not thy state
there is worse weariness than thine
in merely being rich and great
toil only gives the soul to shine
and makes rest fragrant and benign
a heritage, it seems to me
worth being poor to hold in fee

both heirs to some six feet of sod
are equal in the earth at last
both, children of the same dear god
prove title to your heirship vast
by record of a well-filled past
a heritage, it seems to me
well worth a life to hold in fee



oh, east is east, and west is west, and never the twain shall meet
till earth and sky stand presently at god's great judgment seat
but there is neither east nor west, border, nor breed, nor birth
when two strong men stand face to face, tho' they come from the ends
of the earth

kamal is out with twenty men to raise the border side
and he has lifted the colonel's mare that is the colonel's pride
he has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day
and turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away
then up and spoke the colonel's son that led a troop of the guides
then up and spoke mahommed khan, the son of the ressaldar
at dust he harries the abazai--at dawn he is into bonair
but he must go by fort bukloh to his own place to fare
so if ye gallop to fort bukloh as fast as a bird can fly
by the favor of god ye may cut him off ere he win to the tongue of jagai
but if he be passed the tongue of jagai, right swiftly turn ye then
for the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with kamal's
there is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn
between
and ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen
the colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he
with the mouth of a bell and the heart of hell, and the head of the
gallows-tree
the colonel's son to the fort has won, they bid him stay to eat
who rides at the tail of a border thief, he sits not long at his meat
he's up and away from fort bukloh as fast as he can fly
till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the tongue of jagai
till he was aware of his father's mare with kamal upon her back
and when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack
he has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide
it's up and over the tongue of jagai, as blown dust-devils go
the dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe
the dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above
but the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a
glove
there was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn
between
and thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen
they have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn
the dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn
the dun he fell at a water-course--in a woful heap fell he
and kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free
he has knocked the pistol out of his hand--small room was there to strive
there was not a rock of twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree
but covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee
if i had raised my bridle-hand, as i have held it low
the little jackals that flee so fast, were feasting all in a row
if i had bowed my head on my breast, as i have held it high
the kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly
lightly answered the colonel's son: "do good to bird and beast
but count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast
if there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away
belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay
they will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the garnered
grain
the thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are
slain
but if thou thinkest the price be fair,--thy brethren wait to sup
the hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, howl, dog, and call them up
and if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack
give me my father's mare again, and i'll fight my own way back
kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet
may i eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath
what dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with death
lightly answered the colonel's son: "i hold by the blood of my clan
take up the mare of my father's gift--by god, she has carried a man
the red mare ran to the colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast
so she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded rein
my broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain
the colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end
a friend
thy father has sent his son to me, i'll send my son to him
with that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest
he trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest
and thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides
till death or i cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed
thy life is his--thy fate is to guard him with thy head
so thou must eat the white queen's meat, and all her foes are thine
and thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the border-line
and thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power
belike they will raise thee to ressaldar when i am hanged in peshawur
they have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no
fault
they have taken the oath of the brother-in-blood on leavened bread and
they have taken the oath of the brother-in-blood  on fire and fresh-cut
on the hilt and the haft of the khyber knife, and the wondrous names of
the colonel's son he rides the mare and kamal's boy the dun
and two have come back to fort bukloh where there went forth but one
and when they drew to the quarter-guard, full twenty swords flew clear
there was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer
sides
last night ye had struck at a border thief--to-night 'tis a man of the
guides

oh, east is east, and west is west, and never the two shall meet
till earth and sky stand presently at god's great judgment seat
but there is neither east nor west, border, nor breed, nor birth
when two strong men stand face to face, tho' they come from the ends
of the earth



it was many and many a year ago
in a kingdom by the sea
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
by the name of annabel lee
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me

i was a child, and she was a child
in this kingdom by the sea
but we loved with a love that was more than love
i and my annabel lee
with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me

and this was the reason that, long ago
in this kingdom by the sea
a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
my beautiful annabel lee
so that her highborn kinsmen came
and bore her away from me
to shut her up in a sepulchre
in this kingdom by the sea

the angels, not half so happy in heaven
went envying her and me
yes! that was the reason (as all men know
in this kingdom by the sea
that the wind came out of the cloud by night
chilling and killing my annabel lee

but our love it was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we
of many far wiser than we
and neither the angels in heaven above
nor the demons down under the sea
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful annabel lee

for the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
of the beautiful annabel lee
and the stars never rise, but i feel the bright eyes
of the beautiful annabel lee
and so all the night-tide, i lie down by the side
of my darling--my darling--my life and my bride
in her sepulchre there by the sea
in her tomb by the sounding sea



there fell an april shower, one night
next morning, in the garden-bed
the crocuses stood straight and gold

there fell an april shower, one night
next morning, thro' the woodland spread
the mayflowers, pink and sweet as youth

there fell an april shower, one night
next morning, sweetly, overhead
the blue-birds sung, the blue-birds sung



i come, i come! ye have called me long
i come o'er the mountains, with light and song
ye may trace my step o'er the waking earth
by the winds which tell of the violet's birth
by the primrose stars in the shadowy grass
by the green leaves opening as i pass

i have breathed on the south, and the chestnut flowers
by thousands have burst from the forest bowers
and the ancient graves and the fallen fanes
are veiled with wreaths as italian plains
but it is not for me, in my hour of bloom
to speak of the ruin or the tomb

i have looked o'er the hills of the stormy north
and the larch has hung all his tassels forth
the fisher is out on the sunny sea
and the reindeer bounds o'er the pastures free
and the pine has a fringe of softer green
and the moss looks bright, where my step has been

i have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh
and called out each voice of the deep blue sky
from the night-bird's lay through the starry time
in the groves of the soft hesperian clime
to the swan's wild note by the iceland lakes
when the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks

from the streams and founts i have loosed the chain
they are sweeping on to the silvery main
they are flashing down from the mountain brows
they are flinging spray o'er the forest boughs
they are bursting fresh from their sparry caves
and the earth resounds with the joy of waves



has there any old fellow got mixed with the boys
if there has take him out, without making a noise
hang the almanac's cheat and the catalogue's spite
old time is a liar! we're twenty tonight

we're twenty! we're twenty! who says we are more
he's tipsy--young jackanapes!--show him the door
where the snowflakes fall thickest there's nothing can freeze

was it snowing i spoke of? excuse the mistake
look close--you will see not a sign of a flake
we want some new garlands for those we have shed
and these are white roses in place of the red

we've a trick, we young fellows, you may have been told
of talking (in public) as if we were old
that boy we call "doctor," and this we call "judge
it's a neat little fiction--of course it's all fudge

that fellow's the "speaker"--the one on the right
that's our "member of congress," we say when we chaff
there's the "reverend" what's-his-name?--don't make me laugh

that boy with the grave mathematical look
made believe he had written a wonderful book
and the royal society thought it was _true
so they chose him right in; a good joke it was, too

there's a boy, we pretend, with a three-decker brain
that could harness a team with a logical chain
when he spoke for our manhood in syllabled fire
we called him "the justice," but now he's "the squire

and there's a nice youngster of excellent pith
fate tried to conceal him by naming him smith
but he shouted a song for the brave and the free
just read on his medal, "my country," "of thee

you hear that boy laughing? you think he's all fun
but the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done
the children laugh loud as they troop to his call
and the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all

yes, we're boys--always playing with tongue or with pen
and i sometimes have asked, shall we ever be men
shall we always be youthful and laughing and gay
till the last dear companion drops smiling away

then here's to our boyhood, its gold and its gray
the stars of its winter, the dews of its may
and when we have done with our life-lasting toys



the day is cold, and dark, and dreary
it rains, and the wind is never weary
the vine still clings to the mouldering wall
but at every gust the dead leaves fall
and the day is dark and dreary

my life is cold, and dark, and dreary
it rains, and the wind is never weary
my thoughts still cling to the mouldering past
but the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast
and the days are dark and dreary

be still, sad heart! and cease repining
behind the clouds is the sun still shining
thy fate is the common fate of all
into each life some rain must fall
some days must be dark and dreary



of the "house by the side of the way
our master had neither a house nor a home
but he walked with the crowd day by day
and i think, when i read of the poet's desire
that a house by the road would be good
but service is found in its tenderest form
when we walk with the crowd in the road

so i say, let me walk with the men in the road
let me seek out the burdens that crush
let me speak a kind word of good cheer to the weak
who are falling behind in the rush
there are wounds to be healed, there are breaks we must mend
there's a cup of cold water to give
and the man in the road by the side of his friend
is the man who has learned to live

then tell me no more of the house by the road
there is only one place i can live
it's there with the men who are toiling along
who are needing the cheer i can give
it is pleasant to live in the house by the way
and be a friend, as the poet has said
but the master is bidding us, "bear ye their load
for your rest waiteth yonder ahead

i could not remain in the house by the road
and watch as the toilers go on
their faces beclouded with pain and with sin
so burdened, their strength nearly gone
i'll go to their side, i'll speak in good cheer
i'll help them to carry their load
and i'll smile at the man in the house by the way
as i walk with the crowd in the road

out there in the road that goes by the house
where the poet is singing his song
i'll walk and i'll work midst the heat of the day
and i'll help falling brothers along
too busy to live in the house by the way
too happy for such an abode
and my heart sings its praise to the master of all
who is helping me serve in the road



could we but draw back the curtains
that surround each other's lives
see the naked heart and spirit
know what spur the action gives
often we should find it better
purer than we judged we should
we should love each other better
if we only understood

could we judge all deeds by motives
see the good and bad within
often we should love the sinner
all the while we loathe the sin
could we know the powers working
to o'erthrow integrity
we should judge each other's errors
with more patient charity

if we knew the cares and trials
knew the effort all in vain
and the bitter disappointment
understood the loss and gain
would the grim, eternal roughness
seem--i wonder--just the same
should we help where now we hinder
should we pity where we blame

ah! we judge each other harshly
knowing not life's hidden force
knowing not the fount of action
is less turbid at its source
seeing not amid the evil
all the golden grains of good
oh! we'd love each other better
if we only understood


she sat on the sliding cushion
the dear, wee woman of four
her feet, in their shiny slippers
hung dangling over the floor
she meant to be good; she had promised
and so, with her big, brown eyes
she stared at the meeting-house windows
and counted the crawling flies

she looked far up at the preacher
but she thought of the honey bees
droning away at the blossoms
that whitened the cherry trees
she thought of a broken basket
where, curled in a dusky heap
lay snuggled and fast asleep

such soft warm bodies to cuddle
such queer little hearts to beat
such swift, round tongues to kiss
such sprawling, cushiony feet
she could feel in her clasping fingers
the touch of a satiny skin
and a cold wet nose exploring
the dimples under her chin

then a sudden ripple of laughter
ran over the parted lips
so quick that she could not catch it
with her rosy finger-tips
the people whispered, "bless the child
as each one waked from a nap
but the dear, wee woman hid her face
for shame in her mother's lap


it was an old, old, old, old lady
and a boy that was half past three
and the way that they played together
was beautiful to see

she couldn't go running and jumping
and the boy, no more could he
for he was a thin little fellow
with a thin little twisted knee

they sat in the yellow sunlight
out under the maple-tree
and the game that they played i'll tell you
just as it was told to me

it was hide-and-go-seek they were playing
though you'd never have known it to be
with an old, old, old, old lady
and a boy with a twisted knee

the boy would bend his face down
on his one little sound right knee
and he'd guess where she was hiding
in guesses one, two, three

he would cry, and laugh with glee
it wasn't the china-closet
but he still had two and three

in the chest with the queer old key
and she said: "you are _warm_ and _warmer
but you're not quite right," said she

where mamma's things used to be
so it must be the clothes-press, gran'ma
and he found her with his three

then she covered her face with her fingers
that were wrinkled and white and wee
and she guessed where the boy was hiding
with a one and a two and a three

and they never had stirred from their places
right under the maple-tree
this old, old, old, old lady
and the boy with the lame little knee
this dear, dear, dear old lady
and the boy who was half past three



they said, "the master is coming
to honor the town to-day
and none can tell at what house or home
the master will choose to stay
and i thought while my heart beat wildly
what if he should come to mine
how would i strive to entertain
and honor the guest divine

and straight i turned to toiling
to make my house more neat
i swept, and polished, and garnished
and decked it with blossoms sweet
i was troubled for fear the master
might come ere my work was done
and i hasted and worked the faster
and watched the hurrying sun

but right in the midst of my duties
a woman came to my door
she had come to tell me her sorrows
and my comfort and aid to implore
and i said, "i cannot listen
nor help you any, to-day
i have greater things to attend to
and the pleader turned away

but soon there came another
a cripple, thin, pale and gray
and said, "oh, let me stop and rest
a while in your house, i pray
i have traveled far since morning
i am hungry, and faint, and weak
my heart is full of misery
and comfort and help i seek

and i cried, "i am grieved and sorry
but i cannot help you to-day
i look for a great and noble guest
and the cripple went away
and the day wore onward swiftly
and my task was nearly done
and a prayer was ever in my heart
that the master to me might come

and i thought i would spring to meet him
and serve him with utmost care
when a little child stood by me
with a face so sweet and fair
sweet, but with marks of teardrops
and his clothes were tattered and old
a finger was bruised and bleeding
and his little bare feet were cold

and i said, "i'm sorry for you
you are sorely in need of care
but i cannot stop to give it
you must hasten otherwhere
and at the words, a shadow
swept o'er his blue-veined brow
but i am too busy now

at last the day was ended
and my toil was over and done
my house was swept and garnished
and i watched in the dark--alone
watched--but no footfall sounded
no one paused at my gate
no one entered my cottage door
i could only pray--and wait

i waited till night had deepened
and the master had not come
my labor had been for nothing
and i bowed my head and i wept
my heart was sore with longing
yet--in spite of it all--i slept

then the master stood before me
and his face was grave and fair
and craved your pity and care
three times you sent me onward
unhelped and uncomforted
and the blessing you might have had was lost
and your chance to serve has fled

how could i know it was thee
my very soul was shamed and bowed
in the depths of humility
and he said, "the sin is pardoned
but the blessing is lost to thee
for comforting not the least of mine
you have failed to comfort me



i wish there were some wonderful place
called the land of beginning again
where all our mistakes and all our heartaches
and all our poor, selfish griefs
could be dropped, like a shabby old coat, at the door
and never put on again

i wish we could come on it all unaware
like the hunter who finds a lost trail
and i wish that the one whom our blindness had done
the greatest injustice of all
could be at the gate like the old friend that waits
for the comrade he's gladdest to hail

we would find the things we intended to do
but forgot and remembered too late
little praises unspoken, little promises broken
and all of the thousand and one
little duties neglected that might have perfected
the days of one less fortunate

it wouldn't be possible not to be kind
in the land of beginning again
and the ones we misjudged and the ones whom we grudged
their moments of victory here
would find the grasp of our loving handclasp
more than penitent lips could explain

for what had been hardest we'd know had been best
and what had seemed loss would be gain
for there isn't a sting that will not take wing
when we've faced it and laughed it away
and i think that the laughter is most what we're after
in the land of beginning again

so i wish that there were some wonderful place
called the land of beginning again
where all our mistakes and all our heartaches
and all our poor, selfish griefs
could be dropped, like a ragged old coat, at the door
and never put on again



prop yer eyes wide open, joey
fur i've brought you sumpin' great

all amongst a lot of bushes
each one climbin' from a pot
every bush had flowers on it
pretty? mebbe not! oh, no

it was such a stunnin' show

well, i thought of you, poor feller
lyin' here so sick and weak
never knowin' any comfort
and i puts on lots o' cheek
could i ax you for a rose
for my little brother, missus
never seed one, i suppose

then i told her all about you
how i bringed you up--poor joe
sich a imp you was, you know
till you got that awful tumble

saint augustine! well hast thou said
that of our vices we can frame
a ladder, if we will but tread
beneath our feet each deed of shame

all common things, each day's events
that with the hour begin and end
our pleasures and our discontents
are rounds by which we may ascend

the low desire, the base design
that makes another's virtues less
the revel of the ruddy wine
and all occasions of excess

the longing for ignoble things
the strife for triumph more than truth
the hardening of the heart, that brings
irreverence for the dreams of youth

all thoughts of ill; all evil deeds
that have their root in thoughts of ill
whatever hinders or impedes
the action of the nobler will

all these must first be trampled down
beneath our feet, if we would gain
in the bright fields of fair renown
the right of eminent domain

we have not wings, we cannot soar
but we have feet to scale and climb
by slow degrees, by more and more
the cloudy summits of our time

the mighty pyramids of stone
that wedge-like cleave the desert airs
when nearer seen, and better known
are but gigantic flights of stairs

the distant mountains, that uprear
their solid bastions to the skies
are crossed by pathways, that appear
as we to higher levels rise

the heights by great men reached and kept
were not attained by sudden flight
but they, while their companions slept
were toiling upward in the night

standing on what too long we bore
with shoulders bent and downcast eyes
we may discern--unseen before
a path to higher destinies

nor deem the irrevocable past
as wholly wasted, wholly vain
if, rising on its wrecks, at last
to something nobler we attain



when i compare
what i have lost with what i have gained
what i have missed with what attained
little room do i find for pride

i am aware
how many days have been idly spent
how like an arrow the good intent
has fallen short or been turned aside

but who shall dare
to measure loss and gain in this wise
defeat may be victory in disguise
the lowest ebb in the turn of the tide




a fellow near kentucky's clime
cries, "boatman, do not tarry
and i'll give thee a silver dime
to row us o'er the ferry

this dark and stormy water
and she john thompson's daughter

with great precipitation
and should he find us here to-night
i'd lose my reputation

his horsemen hard have pressed me
and who will cheer my bonny bride
if yet they shall arrest me

out spoke the boatman then in time
i'll go not for your silver dime
but--for your manly spirit

in danger shall not tarry
for though a storm is coming on
i'll row you o'er the ferry

by this the wind more fiercely rose
the boat was at the landing
and with the drenching rain their clothes
grew wet where they were standing

but still, as wilder rose the wind
and as the night grew drearer
just back a piece came the police
their tramping sounded nearer

i'll leave the light of loving eyes
but not my father's money

and still they hurried in the race
of wind and rain unsparing
john thompson reached the landing-place
his wrath was turned to swearing

for by the lightning's angry flash
his child he did discover
one lovely hand held all the cash
and one was round her lover

across the stormy water
my daughter, oh, my daughter

the gold he piled went with his child
and he was left there, minus



my grandfather's clock was too tall for the shelf
so it stood ninety years on the floor
it was taller by half than the old man himself
though it weighed not a pennyweight more
it was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
and was always his treasure and pride
but it stopped short ne'er to go again
when the old man died

in watching its pendulum swing to and fro
many hours had he spent while a boy
and in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know
and to share both his grief and his joy
for it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door
with a blooming and beautiful bride
but it stopped short never to go again
when the old man died

my grandfather said that of those he could hire
not a servant so faithful he found
for it wasted no time and had but one desire
at the close of each week to be wound
and it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
and its hands never hung by its side
but it stopped short never to go again
when the old man died



hush! my dear, lie still and slumber
holy angels guard thy bed
heavenly blessings without number
gently falling on thy head

sleep, my babe; thy food and raiment
house and home, thy friends provide
all without thy care or payment
all thy wants are well supplied

how much better thou'rt attended
than the son of god could be
when from heaven he descended
and became a child like thee

soft and easy is thy cradle
coarse and hard thy saviour lay
when his birthplace was a stable
and his softest bed was hay

blessed babe! what glorious features
spotless fair, divinely bright
must he dwell with brutal creatures
how could angels bear the sight

was there nothing but a manger
cursed sinners could afford
to receive the heavenly stranger
did they thus affront their lord

soft, my child: i did not chide thee
though my song might sound too hard
and her arm shall be thy guard

telling wonders from the sky
where they sought him, there they found him
with his virgin mother by

see the lovely babe a-dressing
lovely infant, how he smiled
when he wept, his mother's blessing
soothed and hush'd the holy child

lo, he slumbers in a manger
where the hornèd oxen fed
peace, my darling, here's no danger
there's no ox anear thy bed

trust and love him all thy days
then go dwell forever near him
see his face, and sing his praise



if all the skies were sunshine
our faces would be fain
to feel once more upon them
the cooling splash of rain

if all the world were music
our hearts would often long
for one sweet strain of silence
to break the endless song

if life were always merry
our souls would seek relief
and rest from weary laughter
in the quiet arms of grief



in a valley, centuries ago
grew a little fern leaf, green and slender
veining delicate and fibers tender
waving when the wind crept down so low
rushes tall, and moss, and grass grew round it
playful sunbeams darted in and found it
drops of dew stole down by night and crowned it
but no foot of man e'er came that way
earth was young and keeping holiday

monster fishes swam the silent main
stately forests waved their giant branches
mountains hurled their snowy avalanches
mammoth creatures stalked across the plain
nature reveled in grand mysteries
but the little fern was not like these
did not number with the hills and trees
only grew and waved its sweet, wild way
no one came to note it day by day

earth, one time, put on a frolic mood
heaved the rocks and changed the mighty motion
of the strong, dread currents of the ocean
moved the hills and shook the haughty wood
crushed the little fern in soft, moist clay
covered it, and hid it safe away
oh, the long, long centuries since that day
oh, the changes! oh, life's bitter cost
since the little useless fern was lost

useless? lost? there came a thoughtful man
searching nature's secrets far and deep
from a fissure in a rocky steep
he withdrew a stone, o'er which there ran
fairy pencilings, a quaint design
leafage, veining, fibers, clear and fine
and the fern's life lay in every line
so, i think, god hides some souls away
sweetly to surprise us the last day



cleon hath ten thousand acres
cleon dwelleth in a palace
cleon hath a dozen fortunes
yet the poorer of the twain is

cleon, true, possesseth acres
half the charms to me it yieldeth
money cannot buy
cleon harbors sloth and dullness
he in velvet, i in fustian

cleon is a slave to grandeur
cleon fees a score of doctors
wealth-surrounded, care-environed
cleon fears to die
death may come--he'll find me ready

cleon sees no charms in nature
cleon hears no anthems ringing
nature sings to me forever
state for state, with all attendants



great were the hearts and strong the minds
of those who framed in high debate
the immortal league of love that binds
our fair, broad empire, state with state

and deep the gladness of the hour
when, as the auspicious task was done
in solemn trust the sword of power
was given to glory's unspoiled son

that noble race is gone--the suns
of fifty years have risen and set
but the bright links, those chosen ones
so strongly forged, are brighter yet

wide--as our own free race increase
wide shall extend the elastic chain
and bind in everlasting peace
state after state, a mighty train



a parody on "curfew shall not ring tonight

slow the kansas sun was setting
o'er the wheat fields far away
streaking all the air with cobwebs
at the close of one hot day
and the last rays kissed the forehead
of a man and maiden fair
he with whiskers short and frowsy
she with red and glistening hair
he with shut jaws stern and silent
she, with lips all cold and white
struggled to keep back the murmur

and i have a real lover
though he's rather young and green
but he has a horse and buggy
and a cow and thirty hens
boys that start out poor, dear papa
make the best of honest men
but if towser sees and bites him
fills his eyes with misty light
he will never come again, pa
towser must be tied to-night

like a carving knife through chicken
as it hunts the tender part
two of them are ripe to-day
towser must be loose to watch them
or they'll all be stole away
i have hoed them late and early
in dim morn and evening light
now they're grown i must not lose them
towser'll not be tied to-night

then the old man ambled forward
opened wide the kennel-door
towser bounded forth to meet him
as he oft had done before
and the farmer stooped and loosed him
from the dog-chain short and stout
to himself he softly chuckled
but the maiden at the window
saw the cruel teeth show white
in an undertone she murmured

then the maiden's brow grew thoughtful
and her breath came short and quick
till she spied the family clothesline
and she whispered, "that's the trick
from the kitchen door she glided
with a plate of meat and bread
towser wagged his tail in greeting
knowing well he would be fed
in his well-worn leather collar
tied she then the clothesline tight
all the time her white lips saying

but the front gate's free and open
when john henry lifts the latch
for the clothesline tight is fastened
to the harvest apple tree
you can run and watch the melons
but the front gate you can't see
then her glad ears hear a buggy
and her eyes grow big and bright
while her young heart says in gladness

up the path the young man saunters
with his eye and cheek aglow
for he loves the red-haired maiden
and he aims to tell her so
bessie's roguish little brother
in a fit of boyish glee
had untied the slender clothesline
from the harvest apple tree
then old towser heard the footsteps
raised his bristles, fixed for fight

then old towser bounded forward
passed the open kitchen door
bessie screamed and quickly followed
but john henry's gone before
down the path he speeds most quickly
for old towser sets the pace
and the maiden close behind them
shows them she is in the race
then the clothesline, can she get it
and her eyes grow big and bright
and she springs and grasps it firmly

oftentimes a little minute
forms the destiny of men
you can change the fate of nations
by the stroke of one small pen
towser made one last long effort
caught john henry by the pants
but john henry kept on running
for he thought that his last chance
but the maiden held on firmly
and the rope was drawn up tight
but old towser kept the garments
for he was not tied that night

then the father hears the racket
with long strides he soon is there
when john henry and the maiden
crouching, for the worst prepare
at his feet john tells his story
shows his clothing soiled and torn
and his face so sad and pleading
yet so white and scared and worn
touched the old man's heart with pity
filled his eyes with misty light
towser shall be tied to-night


o liberty, thou child of law
god's seal is on thy brow
o law, her mother first and last
god's very self art thou
two flowers alike, yet not alike
on the same stem that grow
two friends who cannot live apart
yet seem each other's foe
one, the smooth river's mirrored flow
which decks the world with green
and one, the bank of sturdy rock
which hems the river in
o daughter of the timeless past
o hope the prophets saw
god give us law in liberty
and liberty in law



beneath the hot midsummer sun
the men had marched all day
and now beside a rippling stream
upon the grass they lay
tiring of games and idle jest
as swept the hours along
they cried to one who mused apart

are those my mother used to sing
for me long years ago
to every mother's son of us
a mother's songs are dear

then sweetly rose the singer's voice
amid unwonted calm
a follower of the lamb
and shall i fear to own his cause
the very stream was stilled
and hearts that never throbbed with fear
with tender thoughts were filled

ended the song, the singer said
as to his feet he rose
god grant us sweet repose
the soldier bent his head
then, glancing round, with smiling lips

sweet as the bugle call
let angels prostrate fall
ah, wondrous was the old tune's spell
as on the soldiers sang
man after man fell into line
and loud the voices rang

the songs are done, the camp is still
naught but the stream is heard
but, ah! the depths of every soul
by those old hymns are stirred
and up from many a bearded lip
in whispers soft and low
rises the prayer that mother taught
her boy long years ago


we all look on with anxious eyes
when father carves the duck
and mother almost always sighs
when father carves the duck
then all of us prepare to rise
and hold our bibs before our eyes
and be prepared for some surprise
when father carves the duck

he braces up and grabs the fork
whene'er he carves the duck
and won't allow a soul to talk
until he carves the duck
the fork is jabbed into the sides
across the breast the knife he slides
while every careful person hides
from flying chips of duck

the platter's always sure to slip
when father carves the duck
and how it makes the dishes skip
potatoes fly amuck
the squash and cabbage leap in space
we get some gravy in our face
and father mutters hindoo grace
whene'er he carves a duck

we then have learned to walk around
the dining room and pluck
from off the window-sills and walls
our share of father's duck
while father growls and blows and jaws
and swears the knife was full of flaws
and mother laughs at him because
he couldn't carve a duck



i was sitting in my study
writing letters when i heard
mamma mustn't be 'isturbed

want some ozzer fing to do
witing letters, is 'ou, mamma
tan't i wite a letter too

run and play with kitty, now
tan if 'ou will show me how

i would paint my darling's portrait
as his sweet eyes searched my face
hair of gold and eyes of azure
form of childish, witching grace

but the eager face was clouded
as i slowly shook my head
till i said, "i'll make a letter
of you, darling boy, instead

so i parted back the tresses
from his forehead high and white
and a stamp in sport i pasted

then i said, "now, little letter
go away and bear good news
and i smiled as down the staircase
clattered loud the little shoes

leaving me, the darling hurried
down to mary in his glee
i'se a letter, mary--see

no one heard the little prattler
as once more he climbed the stair
reached his little cap and tippet
standing on the entry stair

no one heard the front door open
no one saw the golden hair
as it floated o'er his shoulders
in the crisp october air

down the street the baby hastened
till he reached the office door
is there room for any more

papa lives with god, 'ou know
mamma sent me for a letter
does 'ou fink 'at i tan go

but the clerk in wonder answered

fain the clerk would have detained him
but the pleading face was gone
and the little feet were hastening
by the busy crowd swept on

suddenly the crowd was parted
people fled to left and right
as a pair of maddened horses
at the moment dashed in sight

no one saw the baby figure
no one saw the golden hair
till a voice of frightened sweetness
rang out on the autumn air

stood the beauteous vision there
then the little face lay lifeless
covered o'er with golden hair

reverently they raised my darling
brushed away the curls of gold
saw the stamp upon the forehead
growing now so icy cold

not a mark the face disfigured
showing where a hoof had trod
but the little life was ended


will you listen to me
who stole four eggs i laid
and the nice nest i made

such a thing i'd never do
i gave you a wisp of hay
but didn't take your nest away
not i," said the cow, "moo-oo
such a thing i'd never do

will you listen to me
who stole four eggs i laid
and the nice nest i made

i wouldn't be so mean, anyhow
i gave the hairs the nest to make
but the nest i did not take
not i," said the dog, "bow-wow
i'm not so mean, anyhow

will you listen to me
who stole four eggs i laid
and the nice nest i made

i wouldn't treat a poor bird so
i gave the wool the nest to line
but the nest was none of mine
baa! baa!" said the sheep; "oh, no
i wouldn't treat a poor bird so

what thief took away
a bird's nest to-day

said little mary green
of anything so mean

said little alice neal
how sad the bird would feel

a little boy hung down his head
and went and hid behind the bed
for he stole that pretty nest
from poor little yellow-breast
and he felt so full of shame
he didn't like to tell his name



i, who was always counted, they say
rather a bad stick anyway
splintered all over with dodges and tricks
known as "the worst of the deacon's six
i, the truant, saucy and bold
the one black sheep in my father's fold
went over the hill on a winter's day

tom could save what twenty could earn
but _givin'_ was somethin' he ne'er would learn
isaac could half o' the scriptur's speak
committed a hundred verses a week
never forgot, an' never slipped
but "honor thy father and mother," he skipped

as for susan, her heart was kind
an' good--what there was of it, mind
nothin' too big, an' nothin' too nice
nothin' she wouldn't sacrifice
for one she loved; an' that 'ere one
was herself, when all was said an' done
an' charley an' 'becca meant well, no doubt
but anyone could pull 'em about
an' all o' our folks ranked well, you see
save one poor fellow, an' that was me
an' when, one dark an' rainy night
a neighbor's horse went out o' sight
they hitched on me, as the guilty chap
that carried one end o' the halter-strap
an' i think, myself, that view of the case
wasn't altogether out o' place
my mother denied it, as mothers do
but i am inclined to believe 'twas true
though for me one thing might be said
that i, as well as the horse, was led
and the worst of whisky spurred me on
or else the deed would have never been done
but the keenest grief i ever felt
was when my mother beside me knelt
an' cried, an' prayed, till i melted down
as i wouldn't for half the horses in town
i kissed her fondly, then an' there
an' swore henceforth to be honest and square

i served my sentence--a bitter pill
some fellows should take who never will
and then i decided to go "out west
concludin' 'twould suit my health the best
where, how i prospered, i never could tell
but fortune seemed to like me well
an' somehow every vein i struck
was always bubbling over with luck
an', better than that, i was steady an' true
an' put my good resolutions through
but i wrote to a trusty old neighbor, an' said
an' died a christian; 'twill please 'em more
than if i had lived the same as before

but when this neighbor he wrote to me
i had a resurrection straightway
an' started for her that very day
and when i arrived where i was grown
i took good care that i shouldn't be known
but i bought the old cottage, through and through
of someone charley had sold it to
and held back neither work nor gold
to fix it up as it was of old
the same big fire-place, wide and high
flung up its cinders toward the sky
the old clock ticked on the corner-shelf
i wound it an' set it a-goin' myself
an' if everything wasn't just the same
neither i nor money was to blame

one blowin', blusterin' winter's day
with a team an' cutter i started away
my fiery nags was as black as coal
i hitched, an' entered the poor-house door
a poor old woman was scrubbin' the floor
she rose to her feet in great surprise
and looked, quite startled, into my eyes
i saw the whole of her trouble's trace
in the lines that marred her dear old face
you're adopted along o' your horse thief son

she didn't faint; she knelt by my side
an' thanked the lord, till i fairly cried
an' maybe our ride wasn't pleasant an' gay
an' maybe she wasn't wrapped up that day
an' maybe our cottage wasn't warm an' bright
an' maybe it wasn't a pleasant sight
to see her a-gettin' the evenin's tea
an' frequently stoppin' an' kissin' me
an' maybe we didn't live happy for years
in spite of my brothers' and sisters' sneers
who often said, as i have heard
that they wouldn't own a prison-bird
for all of 'em owe me more or less
but i've learned one thing; an' it cheers a man
in always a-doin' the best he can
that whether on the big book, a blot
gets over a fellow's name or not
whenever he does a deed that's white
it's credited to him fair and right
an' when you hear the great bugle's notes
an' the lord divides his sheep and goats
however they may settle my case
wherever they may fix my place
my good old christian mother, you'll see
will be sure to stand right up for me
with _over the hill from the poor-house



i was mighty good-lookin' when i was young
peart an' black-eyed an' slim
with fellers a-courtin' me sunday nights

the likeliest one of 'em all was he
chipper an' han'som' an' trim
but i tossed up my head an' made fun o' the crowds

i said i hadn't no 'pinion o' men
an' i wouldn't take stock in him
but they kep' up a-comin' in spite o' my talk

i got so tired o' havin' 'em roun
i made up my mind i'd settle down
an' take up with him

so we was married one sunday in church


o'grady lived in shanty row
the neighbors often said
they wished that tim would move away
or that his goat was dead
he kept the neighborhood in fear
and the children always vexed
they couldn't tell jist whin or where
the goat would pop up next

ould missis casey stood wan day
the dirty clothes to rub
upon the washboard, when she dived
headforemosht o'er the tub
she lit upon her back an' yelled
as she was lying flat
o'grady's goat doon that

pat doolan's woife hung out the wash
upon the line to dry
she wint to take it in at night
but stopped to have a cry
the sleeves av two red flannel shirts
that once were worn by pat
were chewed off almost to the neck
o'grady's goat doon that

they had a party at mccune's
an' they wor having foon
whin suddinly there was a crash
an' ivrybody roon
the iseter soup fell on the floor
an' nearly drowned the cat
the stove was knocked to smithereens
o'grady's goat doon that

moike dyle was coortin' biddy shea
both standin' at the gate
an' they wor just about to kiss
aich oother sly and shwate
they coom togither loike two rams
an' mashed their noses flat
they niver shpake whin they goes by
o'grady's goat doon that

o'hoolerhan brought home a keg
av dannymite wan day
to blow a cistern in his yard
an' hid the stuff away
but suddinly an airthquake coom
o'hoolerhan, house an' hat
an' ivrything in sight wint up
o'grady's goat doon that

an' there was dooley's savhin's bank
that held the byes' sphare cash
one day the news came doon the sthreet
the bank had gone to smash
an' ivrybody 'round was dum
wid anger and wid fear
fer on the dhoor they red the whords

the folks in grady's naborhood
all live in fear and fright
they think it's certain death to go
around there after night
an' in their shlape they see a ghost
upon the air afloat
an' wake thimselves by shoutin' out



bethpeor; but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day

by nebo's lonely mountain
on this side jordan's wave
in a vale in the land of moab
there lies a lonely grave
and no man knows that sepulchre
and no man saw it e'er
for the angels of god upturn'd the sod
and laid the dead man there

that was the grandest funeral
that ever pass'd on earth
but no man heard the trampling
or saw the train go forth
noiselessly as the daylight
comes back when night is done
and the crimson streak on ocean's cheek
grows into the great sun

noiselessly as the springtime
her crown of verdure weaves
and all the trees on all the hills
open their thousand leaves
so without sound of music
or voice of them that wept
silently down from the mountain's crown
the great procession swept

perchance the bald old eagle
on gray beth-peor's height
out of his lonely eyrie
look'd on the wondrous sight
perchance the lion, stalking
still shuns that hallow'd spot
for beast and bird have seen and heard
that which man knoweth not

but when the warrior dieth
his comrades in the war
with arms reversed and muffled drum
follow his funeral car
they show the banners taken
they tell his battles won
and after him lead his masterless steed
while peals the minute gun

amid the noblest of the land
we lay the sage to rest
and give the bard an honor'd place
with costly marble drest
in the great minster transept
where lights like glories fall
and the organ rings, and the sweet choir sings
along the emblazon'd wall

this was the truest warrior
that ever buckled sword
this was the most gifted poet
that ever breathed a word
and never earth's philosopher
traced with his golden pen
on the deathless page, truths half so sage
as he wrote down for men

and had he not high honor
the hillside for a pall
to lie in state while angels wait
with stars for tapers tall
and the dark rock-pines like tossing plumes
over his bier to wave
and god's own hand, in that lonely land
to lay him in the grave

in that strange grave without a name
whence his uncoffin'd clay
shall break again, o wondrous thought
before the judgment day
and stand with glory wrapt around
on the hills he never trod
and speak of the strife that won our life
with the incarnate son of god

o lonely grave in moab's land
o dark beth-peor's hill
speak to these curious hearts of ours
and teach them to be still
god hath his mysteries of grace
ways that we cannot tell
he hides them deep like the hidden sleep
of him he loved so well



alone in the dreary, pitiless street
with my torn old dress, and bare, cold feet
all day have i wandered to and fro
hungry and shivering, and nowhere to go
the night's coming on in darkness and dread
and the chill sleet beating upon my bare head
oh! why does the wind blow upon me so wild
is it because i am nobody's child

just over the way there's a flood of light
and warmth, and beauty, and all things bright
beautiful children, in robes so fair
are caroling songs in their rapture there
i wonder if they, in their blissful glee
would pity a poor little beggar like me
wandering alone in the merciless street
naked and shivering, and nothing to eat

oh! what shall i do when the night comes down
in its terrible blackness all over the town
shall i lay me down 'neath the angry sky
on the cold, hard pavement, alone to die
when the beautiful children their prayers have said
and their mammas have tucked them up snugly in bed
for no dear mother on me ever smiled
why is it, i wonder, i'm nobody's child

no father, no mother, no sister, not one
in all the world loves me--e'en the little dogs run
when i wander too near them; 'tis wondrous to see
how everything shrinks from a beggar like me
perhaps 'tis a dream; but sometimes, when i lie
gazing far up in the dark blue sky
watching for hours some large bright star
i fancy the beautiful gates are ajar

and a host of white-robed, nameless things
come fluttering o'er me on gilded wings
a hand that is strangely soft and fair
caresses gently my tangled hair
and a voice like the carol of some wild bird
the sweetest voice that was ever heard
calls me many a dear, pet name
till my heart and spirit are all aflame

they tell me of such unbounded love
and bid me come to their home above
and then with such pitiful, sad surprise
they look at me with their sweet, tender eyes
and it seems to me, out of the dreary night
i am going up to that world of light
and away from the hunger and storm so wild
i am sure i shall then be somebody's child



like a dream, it all comes o'er me as i hear the christmas bells
like a dream it floats before me, while the christmas anthem swells
like a dream it bears me onward in the silent, mystic flow
to a dear old sunny christmas in the happy long ago

and my thoughts go backward, backward, and the years that intervene
are but as the mists and shadows when the sunlight comes between
and all earthly wealth and splendor seem but as a fleeting show
as there comes to me the picture of a christmas long ago

i can see the great, wide hearthstone and the holly hung about
i can see the smiling faces, i can hear the children shout
i can feel the joy and gladness that the old room seem to fill
e'en the shadows on the ceiling--i can see them dancing still

i can see the little stockings hung about the chimney yet
i can feel my young heart thrilling lest the old man should forget
ah! that fancy! were the world mine, i would give it, if i might
to believe in old st. nicholas, and be a child to-night

just to hang my little stocking where it used to hang, and feel
for one moment all the old thoughts and the old hopes o'er me steal
but, oh! loved and loving faces, in the firelight's dancing glow
there will never come another like that christmas long ago

for the old home is deserted, and the ashes long have lain
in the great, old-fashioned fireplace that will never shine again
friendly hands that then clasped ours now are folded 'neath the snow
gone the dear ones who were with us on that christmas long ago

let the children have their christmas--let them have it while they may
life is short and childhood's fleeting, and there'll surely come a day
when st. nicholas will sadly pass on by the close-shut door
missing all the merry faces that had greeted him of yore

when no childish step shall echo through the quiet, silent room
when no childish smile shall brighten, and no laughter lift the gloom
when the shadows that fall 'round us in the fire-light's fitful glow
shall be ghosts of those who sat there in the christmas long ago


one sweetly solemn thought
comes to me o'er and o'er
i am nearer home to-day
than i've ever been before

nearer my father's house
where the many mansions be
nearer the great white throne
nearer the jasper sea

nearer the bound of life
where we lay our burdens down
nearer leaving the cross
nearer gaining the crown

but lying darkly between
winding down through the night
is the dim and unknown stream
that leads at last to the light

closer and closer my steps
come to the dark abysm
closer death to my lips
presses the awful chrism

father, perfect my trust
strengthen the might of my faith
let me feel as i would when i stand
on the rock of the shore of death

feel as i would when my feet
are slipping o'er the brink
for it may be i am nearer home
nearer now than i think



grandma told me all about it
told me so i could not doubt it
how she danced, my grandma danced, long ago
how she held her pretty head
how her dainty skirts she spread
how she turned her little toes
smiling little human rose

grandma's hair was bright and shining
dimpled cheeks, too! ah! how funny
bless me, now she wears a cap
my grandma does, and takes a nap every single day
yet she danced the minuet long ago
now she sits there rocking, rocking
always knitting grandpa's stocking
every girl was taught to knit long ago
but her figure is so neat
and her ways so staid and sweet
i can almost see her now
bending to her partner's bow, long ago

grandma says our modern jumping
rushing, whirling, dashing, bumping
would have shocked the gentle people long ago
no, they moved with stately grace
everything in proper place
gliding slowly forward, then
slowly courtesying back again

modern ways are quite alarming, grandma says
but boys were charming
girls and boys i mean, of course--long ago
sweetly modest, bravely shy
what if all of us should try just to feel
like those who met in the stately minuet, long ago
with the minuet in fashion
who could fly into a passion
all would wear the calm they wore long ago
and if in years to come, perchance
i tell my grandchild of our dance
i should really like to say
we did it in some such way, long ago



roger's my dog--come here, you scamp
jump for the gentleman--mind your eye
over the table--look out for the lamp
the rogue is growing a little old
five years we've tramped through wind and weather
and slept outdoors when nights were cold
and ate, and drank--and starved together

we've learned what comfort is, i tell you
a bed on the floor, a bit of rosin
a fire to thaw our thumbs (poor fellow
the paw he holds up there has been frozen
plenty of catgut for my fiddle
then a few nice buckwheats hot from the griddle
and roger and i set up for kings

no, thank you, sir, i never drink
roger and i are exceedingly moral
aren't we, roger? see him wink
well, something hot then, we won't quarrel
he's thirsty, too--see him nod his head
what a pity, sir, that dogs can't talk
he understands every word that's said
and he knows good milk from water and chalk

the truth is, sir, now i reflect
i've been so sadly given to grog
i wonder i've not lost the respect
but he sticks by through thick and thin
and this old coat with its empty pockets
and rags that smell of tobacco and gin
he'll follow while he has eyes in his sockets

there isn't another creature living
would do it, and prove, through every disaster
so fond, so faithful, and so forgiving
to such a miserable, thankless master
no, sir! see him wag his tail and grin
by george! it makes my old eyes water
that is, there's something in this gin
that chokes a fellow, but no matter

we'll have some music, if you're willing
and roger (hem! what a plague a cough is, sir
shall march a little.--start, you villain
paws up! eyes front! salute your officer
your cap while the gentleman gives a trifle
to aid a poor old patriot soldier

march! halt! now show how the rebel shakes
when he stands up to hear his sentence
now tell me how many drams it takes
to honor a jolly new acquaintance
five yelps--that's five; he's mighty knowing
the night's before us, fill the glasses
quick, sir! i'm ill, my brain is going
some brandy,--thank you;--there,--it passes

why not reform? that's easily said
but i've gone through such wretched treatment
sometimes forgetting the taste of bread
and scarce remembering what meat meant
that my poor stomach's past reform
and there are times when, mad with thinking
i'd sell out heaven for something warm
to prop a horrible inward sinking

is there a way to forget to think
at your age, sir, home, fortune, friends
a dear girl's love,--but i took to drink
the same old story; you know how it ends
if you could have seen these classic features
you needn't laugh, sir; i was not then
such a burning libel on god's creatures
i was one of your handsome men

if you had seen her, so fair, so young
whose head was happy on this breast
if you could have heard the songs i sung
when the wine went round, you wouldn't have guess'd
that ever i, sir, should be straying
from door to door, with fiddle and dog
ragged and penniless, and playing
to you to-night for a glass of grog

she's married since,--a parson's wife
better the soberest, prosiest life
than a blasted home and a broken heart
i have seen her--once; i was weak and spent
on the dusty road; a carriage stopped
but little she dreamed as on she went
who kissed the coin that her fingers dropped

you've set me talking, sir; i'm sorry
it makes me wild to think of the change
what do you care for a beggar's story
is it amusing? you find it strange
i had a mother so proud of me
if the happy spirits in heaven can see
the ruin and wretchedness here below

another glass, and strong, to deaden
this pain; then roger and i will start
i wonder, has he such a lumpish, leaden
aching thing, in place of a heart
he is sad sometimes, and would weep, if he could
no doubt, remembering things that were
a virtuous kennel, with plenty of food
and himself a sober, respectable cur

i'm better now; that glass was warming
you rascal! limber your lazy feet
we must be fiddling and performing
for supper and bed, or starve in the street
not a very gay life to lead, you think
but soon we shall go where lodgings are free
and the sleepers need neither victuals nor drink
the sooner, the better for roger and me



oh, a wonderful stream is the river of time
as it runs through the realm of tears
with a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme
and a boundless sweep and a surge sublime
as it blends with the ocean of years

how the winters are drifting, like flakes of snow
and the summers, like buds between
and the year in the sheaf--so they come and they go
on the river's breast, with its ebb and flow
as it glides in the shadow and sheen

there's a magical isle up the river of time
where the softest of airs are playing
there's a cloudless sky and a tropical clime
and a song as sweet as a vesper chime
and the junes with the roses are staying

and the name of that isle is the long ago
and we bury our treasures there
there are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow
there are heaps of dust--but we love them so
there are trinkets and tresses of hair

there are fragments of song that nobody sings
and a part of an infant's prayer
there's a lute unswept, and a harp without strings
there are broken vows and pieces of rings
and the garments that she used to wear

there are hands that are waved, when the fairy shore
by the mirage is lifted in air
and we sometimes hear, through the turbulent roar
sweet voices we heard in the days gone before
when the wind down the river is fair

oh, remembered for aye be the blessed isle
all the day of our life till night
when the evening comes with its beautiful smile
and our eyes are closing to slumber awhile
may that "greenwood" of soul be in sight


note: the last line of this poem needs explanation. "greenwood" is the
name of a cemetery in brooklyn, n.y. "greenwood of soul" means the
soul's resting place, or heaven


in an attic bare and cheerless, jim the newsboy dying lay
on a rough but clean straw pallet, at the fading of the day
scant the furniture about him but bright flowers were in the room
crimson phloxes, waxen lilies, roses laden with perfume
on a table by the bedside open at a well-worn page
where the mother had been reading lay a bible stained by age
now he could not hear the verses; he was flighty, and she wept
with her arms around her youngest, who close to her side had crept

blacking boots and selling papers, in all weathers day by day
brought upon poor jim consumption, which was eating life away
and this cry came with his anguish for each breath a struggle cost
papers, mister? morning papers?" then the cry fell to a moan
which was changed a moment later to another frenzied tone
it grows late, jack! night is coming. evening papers, here they are

soon a mission teacher entered, and approached the humble bed
then poor jim's mind cleared an instant, with his cool hand on his head
ma's been reading of the saviour, and through him i see my way
he is with me! jack, i charge you of our mother take good care
when jim's gone! hark! boots or papers, which will i be over there
black yer boots, sir? shine 'em right up! papers! read god's book instead
better'n papers that to die on! jack--" one gasp, and jim was dead

floating from that attic chamber came the teacher's voice in prayer
and it soothed the bitter sorrow of the mourners kneeling there
he commended them to heaven, while the tears rolled down his face
thanking god that jim had listened to sweet words of peace and grace
ever 'mid the want and squalor of the wretched and the poor
kind hearts find a ready welcome, and an always open door
for the sick are in strange places, mourning hearts are everywhere
and such need the voice of kindness, need sweet sympathy and prayer



break, break, break
on thy cold gray stones, o sea
and i would that my tongue could utter
the thoughts that arise in me

o well for the fisherman's boy
that he shouts with his sister at play
o well for the sailor lad
that he sings in his boat on the bay

and the stately ships go on
to their haven under the hill
but o for the touch of a vanished hand
and the sound of a voice that is still

break, break, break
at the foot of thy crags, o sea
but the tender grace of a day that is dead
will never come back to me



don't kill the birds, the pretty birds
that sing about your door
soon as the joyous spring has come
and chilling storms are o'er
the little birds, how sweet they sing
oh! let them joyous live
and never seek to take the life
that you can never give

don't kill the birds, the pretty birds
that play among the trees
should we dispense with these
the little birds, how fond they play
do not disturb their sport
but let them warble forth their songs
till winter cuts them short

don't kill the birds, the happy birds
that bless the fields and grove
so innocent to look upon
they claim our warmest love
the happy birds, the tuneful birds
how pleasant 'tis to see
no spot can be a cheerless place
where'er their presence be



i've got a letter, parson, from my son away out west
an' my old heart is heavy as an anvil in my breast
to think the boy whose future i had once so nicely planned
should wander from the right and come to such a bitter end

i told him when he left us, only three short years ago
he'd find himself a-plowing in a mighty crooked row
he'd miss his father's counsel and his mother's prayers, too
but he said the farm was hateful, an' he guessed he'd have to go

i know there's big temptations for a youngster in the west
but i believed our billy had the courage to resist
an' when he left i warned him of the ever waitin' snares
that lie like hidden serpents in life's pathway everywheres

but bill, he promised faithful to be careful, an' allowed
that he'd build a reputation that'd make us mighty proud
but it seems as how my counsel sort o' faded from his mind
and now he's got in trouble of the very worstest kind

his letters came so seldom that i somehow sort o' knowed
that billy was a-trampin' of a mighty rocky road
but never once imagined he would bow my head in shame
and in the dust would woller his old daddy's honored name

he writes from out in denver, an' the story's mighty short
i jess can't tell his mother!--it'll crush her poor old heart
an' so i reckoned, parson, you might break the news to her
bill's in the legislature but he doesn't say what fur


an old man going a lone highway
came, at the evening cold and gray
to a chasm vast and deep and wide
the old man crossed in the twilight dim
the sullen stream had no fear for him
but he turned when safe on the other side
and built a bridge to span the tide

your journey will end with the ending day
yon never again will pass this way
you've crossed the chasm, deep and wide
why build this bridge at evening tide

the builder lifted his old gray head
a youth whose feet must pass this way
this chasm that has been as naught to me
to that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be
he, too, must cross in the twilight dim
good friend, i am building this bridge for him



our band is few, but true and tried
our leader frank and bold
the british soldier trembles
when marion's name is told
our fortress is the good green wood
our tent the cypress tree
we know the forest round us
as seamen know the sea
we know its walls of thorny vines
its glades of reedy grass
its safe and silent islands
within the dark morass

woe to the english soldiery
that little dread us near
on them shall light at midnight
a strange and sudden fear
when, waking to their tents on fire
they grasp their arms in vain
and they who stand to face us
are beat to earth again
and they who fly in terror deem
a mighty host behind
and hear the tramp of thousands
upon the hollow wind

then sweet the hour that brings release
from danger and from toil
we talk the battle over
and share the battle's spoil
the woodland rings with laugh and shout
as if a hunt were up
and woodland flowers are gathered
to crown the soldier's cup
with merry songs we mock the wind
that in the pine-top grieves
and slumber long and sweetly
on beds of oaken leaves

well knows the fair and friendly moon
the band that marion leads
the glitter of their rifles
the scampering of their steeds
across the moonlight plains
that lifts their tossing manes
a moment in the british camp
a moment--and away
back to the pathless forest
before the peep of day

grave men there are by broad santee
grave men with hoary hairs
their hearts are all with marion
for marion are their prayers
and lovely ladies greet our band
with kindliest welcoming
with smiles like those of summer
and tears like those of spring
for them we wear these trusty arms
and lay them down no more
till we have driven the briton
forever from our shore



the minstrel-boy to the war is gone
in the ranks of death you'll find him
his father's sword he has girded on
and his wild harp slung behind him
one sword, at least, thy rights shall guard
one faithful harp shall praise thee
the minstrel fell!--but the foeman's chain
could not bring his proud soul under
the harp he loved ne'er spoke again
for he tore its chords asunder
and said, "no chains shall sully thee
thou soul of love and bravery
thy songs were made for the pure and free
they shall never sound in slavery



our old brown homestead reared its walls
from the wayside dust aloof
where the apple-boughs could almost cast
their fruitage on its roof
and the cherry-tree so near it grew
that when awake i've lain
in the lonesome nights, i've heard the limbs
as they creaked against the pane
and those orchard trees, o those orchard trees
i've seen my little brothers rocked
in their tops by the summer breeze

the sweet-brier under the window-sill
which the early birds made glad
and the damask rose by the garden fence
were all the flowers we had
i've looked at many a flower since then
exotics rich and rare
that to other eyes were lovelier
but not to me so fair
o those roses bright, o those roses bright
i have twined them with my sister's locks
that are hid in the dust from sight

we had a well, a deep old well
where the spring was never dry
and the cool drops down from the mossy stones
were falling constantly
and there never was water half so sweet
as that in my little cup
drawn up to the curb by the rude old sweep
which my father's hand set up
and that deep old well, o that deep old well
i remember yet the splashing sound
of the bucket as it fell

our homestead had an ample hearth
where at night we loved to meet
there my mother's voice was always kind
and her smile was always sweet
and there i've sat on my father's knee
and watched his thoughtful brow
with my childish hand in his raven hair
that hair is silver now
but that broad hearth's light, o that broad hearth's light
and my father's look, and my mother's smile
they are in my heart to-night



we were crowded in the cabin
not a soul would dare to sleep
it was midnight on the waters
and a storm was on the deep

to be shattered by the blast
and to hear the rattling trumpet
thunder, "cut away the mast

so we shuddered there in silence
for the stoutest held his breath
while the hungry sea was roaring
and the breakers talked with death

as thus we sat in darkness
each one busy with his prayers
as he staggered down the stairs

but his little daughter whispered
as she took his icy hand
just the same as on the land

then we kissed the little maiden
and we spoke in better cheer
and we anchored safe in harbor
when the morn was shining clear



whene'er a noble deed is wrought
whene'er is spoken a noble thought
our hearts, in glad surprise
to higher levels rise

the tidal wave of deeper souls
into our inmost being rolls
and lifts us unawares
out of all meaner cares

honor to those whose words or deeds
thus help us in our daily needs
and by their overflow
raise us from what is low

thus thought i, as by night i read
of the great army of the dead
the trenches cold and damp
the starved and frozen camp

the wounded from the battle-plain
in dreary hospitals of pain
the cheerless corridors
the cold and stony floors

lo! in that house of misery
a lady with a lamp i see
pass through the glimmering gloom
and flit from room to room

and slow, as in a dream of bliss
the speechless sufferer turns to kiss
her shadow, as it falls
upon the darkening walls

as if a door in heaven should be
opened and then closed suddenly
the vision came and went
the light shone and was spent

on england's annals, through the long
hereafter of her speech and song
that light its rays shall cast
from portals of the past

a lady with a lamp shall stand
in the great history of the land
a noble type of good
heroic womanhood

nor even shall be wanting here
the palm, the lily, and the spear
the symbols that of yore
saint filomena bore



the feast is o'er! now brimming wine
in lordly cup is seen to shine
before each eager guest
and silence fills the crowded hall
as deep as when the herald's call
thrills in the loyal breast

then up arose the noble host
and, smiling, cried: "a toast! a toast
to all our ladies fair
here before all, i pledge the name
of staunton's proud and beauteous dame
the ladye gundamere

then to his feet each gallant sprung
and joyous was the shout that rung
as stanley gave the word
and every cup was raised on high
nor ceased the loud and gladsome cry
till stanley's voice was heard

and lowly bent his haughty head
now each in turn must play his part
and pledge the lady of his heart
like gallant knight and true

then one by one each guest sprang up
and drained in turn the brimming cup
and named the loved one's name
and each, as hand on high he raised
his lady's grace or beauty praised
her constancy and fame

on him are fixed those countless eyes
a gallant knight is he
envied by some, admired by all
far famed in lady's bower and hall
the flower of chivalry

st. leon raised his kindling eye
and lifts the sparkling cup on high
deep graven on this grateful heart
till memory be dead

when lighter passions long have past
so holy 'tis and true
to one, whose love hath longer dwelt
more deeply fixed, more keenly felt
than any pledged by you

each guest upstarted at the word
and laid a hand upon his sword
with fury flashing eye
and stanley said: "we crave the name
proud knight, of this most peerless dame
whose love you count so high

st. leon paused, as if he would
not breathe her name in careless mood
thus lightly to another
then bent his noble head, as though
to give that word the reverence due
and gently said: "my mother



o for one hour of youthful joy
give back my twentieth spring
i'd rather laugh a bright-haired boy
than reign a gray-beard king

off with the spoils of wrinkled age
away with learning's crown
tear out life's wisdom-written page
and dash its trophies down

one moment let my life-blood stream
from boyhood's fount of flame
give me one giddy, reeling dream
of life all love and fame

my listening angel heard the prayer
and, calmly smiling, said
thy hasty wish hath sped

to bid thee fondly stay
while the swift seasons hurry back
to find the wished-for day

ah! truest soul of womankind
without thee what were life
one bliss i cannot leave behind
i'll take--my--precious--wife

the angel took a sapphire pen
and wrote in rainbow dew
and be a husband, too

before the change appears
remember, all their gifts have fled
with those dissolving years

my fond paternal joys
i could not bear to leave them all
i'll take--my--girl--and--boys

the smiling angel dropped his pen
the man would be a boy again
and be a father too

and so i laughed--my laughter woke
the household with its noise
and wrote my dream, when morning broke
to please the gray-haired boys



the bells of mount vernon are ringing to-day
and what say their melodious numbers
to the flag blooming air? list, what do they say

the world's monument stands the potomac beside
and what says the shaft to the river
death crowns him a hero forever

the bards crown the heroes and children rehearse
the songs that give heroes to story
and what say the bards to the children? "no verse
can yet measure washington's glory

and freedom shall triumph forever
and time must long wait the true song of his birth
who sleeps by the beautiful river



april! april! are you here
oh, how fresh the wind is blowing
see! the sky is bright and clear
oh, how green the grass is growing
april! april! are you here

april! april! is it you
see how fair the flowers are springing
sun is warm and brooks are clear
oh, how glad the birds are singing
april! april! is it you

april! april! you are here
though your smiling turn to weeping
though your skies grow cold and drear
though your gentle winds are sleeping
april! april! you are here



oh, such a commotion under the ground
when march called, "ho, there! ho
such spreading of rootlets far and wide
such whispering to and fro
and, "are you ready?" the snowdrop asked
then, "ha! ha! ha!" a chorus came
of laughter soft and low
from the millions of flowers under the ground
yes--millions--beginning to grow

o, the pretty brave things! through the coldest days
imprisoned in walls of brown
they never lost heart though the blast shrieked loud
and the sleet and the hail came down

but patiently each wrought her beautiful dress
or fashioned her beautiful crown
and now they are coming to brighten the world
still shadowed by winter's frown
and well may they cheerily laugh, "ha! ha
in a chorus soft and low
the millions of flowers hid under the ground
yes--millions--beginning to grow


god makes sech nights, all white an' still
fur 'z you can look or listen
moonshine an' snow on field an' hill
all silence an' all glisten

zekle crep' up quite unbeknown
an' peeked in thru the winder
an' there sot huldy all alone

a fireplace filled the room's one side
with half a cord o' wood in
there warn't no stoves (tell comfort died
to bake ye to a puddin

the wa'nut logs shot sparkles out
towards the pootiest, bless her
an' leetle flames danced all about
the chiny on the dresser

agin the chimbley crook-necks hung
an' in amongst 'em rusted
the ole queen's-arm thet gran'ther young
fetched back from concord busted

the very room, coz she was in
seemed warm from floor to ceilin
an' she looked full ez rosy agin
ez the apples she was peelin

on sech a blessed cretur
a dogrose blushin' to a brook
ain't modester nor sweeter

he was six foot o' man, a 1
clear grit an' human natur
none couldn't quicker pitch a ton
nor dror a furrer straighter

he'd sparked it with full twenty gals
hed squired 'em, danced 'em, druv 'em
fust this one, an' then thet, by spells
all is, he couldn't love 'em

but long o' her his veins 'ould run
all crinkly like curled maple
the side she breshed felt full o' sun
ez a south slope in ap'il

she thought no v'ice hed sech a swing
ez hisn in the choir
my! when he made ole hunderd ring
she _knowed_ the lord was nigher

an' she'd blush scarlet, right in prayer
when her new meetin'-bunnit
felt somehow thru its crown a pair
o' blue eyes sot upun it

thet night, i tell ye, she looked _some
she seemed to 've gut a new soul
for she felt sartin-sure he'd come
down to her very shoe-sole

she heered a foot, an' knowed it tu
a-raspin' on the scraper
all ways to once her feelin's flew
like sparks in burnt-up paper

he kin' o' l'itered on the mat
some doubtfle o' the sekle
his heart kep' goin' pity-pat
but hern went pity zekle

an' yit she gin her cheer a jerk
ez though she wished him furder
an' on her apples kep' to work
parin' away like murder

agin to-morrer's i'nin

to say why gals acts so or so
or don't, 'ould be presumin
mebby to mean _yes_ an' say _no
comes nateral to women

he stood a spell on one foot fust
then stood a spell on t'other
an' on which one he felt the wust
he couldn't ha' told ye nuther

says he, "i'd better call agin
says she, "think likely, mister
thet last work pricked him like a pin

when ma bimeby upon 'em slips
huldy sot pale ez ashes
all kin' o' smily roun' the lips

it was the twilight hour
behind the western hill the sun had sunk
leaving the evening sky aglow with crimson light
the air is filled with fragrance and with sound
high in the tops of shadowy vine-wreathed trees
grave parent-birds were twittering good-night songs
to still their restless brood
across the way
a noisy little brook made pleasant
music on the summer air
and farther on, the sweet, faint sound
of whippoorwill falls rose on the air, and fell
like some sweet chant at vespers
the air is heavy
with the scent of mignonette and rose
and from the beds of flowers the tall
white lilies point like angel fingers upward
casting on the air an incense sweet
that brings to mind the old, old story
of the alabaster box that loving mary
broke upon the master's feet

upon his vine-wreathed porch
an old white-headed man sits dreaming
happy, happy dreams of days that are no more
and listening to the quaint old song
with which his daughter lulled her child to rest

the darkness deepens
lord, with me abide

and as he listens to the sounds that fill the
summer air, sweet, dreamy thoughts
of his "lost youth" come crowding thickly up
and, for a while, he seems a boy again
with feet all bare
he wades the rippling brook, and with a boyish shout
gathers the violets blue, and nodding ferns
that wave a welcome from the other side
with those he wreathes
the sunny head of little nell, a neighbor's child
companion of his sorrows and his joys
sweet, dainty nell, whose baby life
seemed early linked with his
and whom he loved with all a boy's devotion

long years have flown
no longer boy and girl, but man and woman grown
they stand again beside the brook, that murmurs
ever in its course, nor stays for time nor man
and tell the old, old story
and promise to be true till life for them shall end

again the years roll on
and they are old. the frost of age
has touched the once-brown hair
and left it white as are the chaliced lilies
children, whose rosy lips once claimed
a father's blessing and a mother's love
have grown to man's estate, save two
whom god called early home to wait
for them in heaven

and then the old man thinks
how on a night like this, when faint
and sweet as half-remembered dreams
old whippoorwill falls did murmur soft
its evening psalms, when fragrant lilies
pointed up the way her christ had gone
god called the wife and mother home
and bade him wait
oh! why is it so hard for
man to wait? to sit with folded hands
apart, amid the busy throng
and hear the buzz and hum of toil around
to see men reap and bind the golden sheaves
of earthly fruits, while he looks idly on
and knows he may not join
but only wait till god has said, "enough
and calls him home

and thus the old man dreams
and then awakes; awakes to hear
the sweet old song just dying
on the pulsing evening air

and comforts flee
lord of the helpless
oh, abide with me



god said: i am tired of kings
i suffer them no more
up to my ear the morning brings
the outrage of the poor

think ye i have made this ball
a field of havoc and war
where tyrants great and tyrants small
might harry the weak and poor

my angel--his name is freedom
choose him to be your king
he shall cut pathways east and west
and fend you with his wing

i will never have a noble
no lineage counted great
fishers and choppers and plowmen
shall constitute a state

and ye shall succor man
help them who cannot help again
beware from right to swerve



the rosy clouds float overhead
the sun is going down
and now the sandman's gentle tread
comes stealing through the town
and, as he shakes his hand
straightway there lies on babies' eyes
his gift of shining sand
blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown
as shuts the rose, they softly close
when he goes through the town

from sunny beaches far away
yes, in another land
he gathers up, at break of day
his store of shining sand
no tempests beat that shore remote
no ships may sail that way
his little boat alone may float
within that lovely bay
blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown
as shuts the rose, they softly close
when he goes through the town

he smiles to see the eyelids close
above the happy eyes
and every child right well he knows
oh, he is very wise
but if, as he goes through the land
a naughty baby cries
his other hand takes dull gray sand
to close the wakeful eyes
blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown
as shuts the rose, they softly close
when he goes through the town

so when you hear the sandman's song
sound through the twilight sweet
be sure you do not keep him long
a-waiting in the street
lie softly down, dear little head
rest quiet, busy hands
till by your bed when good-night's said
he strews the shining sands
blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown
as shuts the rose, they softly close
when he goes through the town



ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky
the flying cloud, the frosty light
the year is dying in the night
ring out, wild bells, and let him die

ring out the old, ring in the new
ring, happy bells, across the snow
the year is going, let him go
ring out the false, ring in the true

ring out the grief that saps the mind
for those that here we see no more
ring out the feud of rich and poor
ring in redress to all mankind

ring out a slowly dying cause
and ancient forms of party strife
ring in the nobler modes of life
with sweeter manners, purer laws

ring out false pride in place and blood
the civic slander and the spite
ring in the love of truth and right
ring in the common love of good

ring out old shapes of foul disease
ring out the narrowing lust of gold
ring out the thousand wars of old
ring in the thousand years of peace

ring in the valiant man and free
the larger heart, the kindlier hand
ring out the darkness of the land
ring in the christ that is to be



among the legends sung or said
along our rocky shore
the wishing bridge of marblehead
may well be sung once more

an hundred years ago (so ran
the old-time story) all
good wishes said above its span
would, soon or late, befall

if pure and earnest, never failed
the prayers of man or maid
for him who on the deep sea sailed
for her at home who stayed

once thither came two girls from school
and wished in childish glee
and one would be a queen and rule
and one the world would see

time passed; with change of hopes and fears
and in the selfsame place
two women, gray with middle years
stood wondering, face to face

with wakened memories, as they met
they queried what had been
said one, "i am a queen

where, lacking crown and throne
i rule by loving services
and patient toil alone

the other said: "the great world lies
beyond me as it laid
o'er love's and duty's boundaries
my feet have never strayed

its common sounds i hear
my widowed mother's sick-bed room
sufficeth for my sphere

of travel far and wide
and in a dreamy pilgrimage
we wander side by side

my book becomes to me
a magic glass: my watch i keep
but all the world i see

while fancy's privilege
is mine to walk the earth at will
thanks to the wishing bridge

the other cried, "and say
god gives the wishes of our youth
but in his own best way



these are the things i hold divine
a trusting chi id's hand laid in mine
rich brown earth and wind-tossed trees
the taste of grapes and the drone of bees
a rhythmic gallop, long june days
a rose-hedged lane and lovers' lays
the welcome smile on neighbors' faces
cool, wide hills and open places
breeze-blown fields of silver rye
the wild, sweet note of the plover's cry
fresh spring showers and scent of box
the soft, pale tint of the garden phlox
lilacs blooming, a drowsy noon
a flight of geese and an autumn moon
rolling meadows and storm-washed heights
a fountain murmur on summer nights
a dappled fawn in the forest hush
simple words and the song of a thrush
rose-red dawns and a mate to share
with comrade soul my gypsy fare
a waiting fire when the twilight ends
a gallant heart and the voice of friends



the bravest battle that ever was fought
shall i tell you where and when
on the map of the world you will find it not

nay, not with cannon or battle shot
with sword or nobler pen
nay, not with eloquent words or thought
from mouths of wonderful men

but deep in the walled-up woman's heart
of woman that would not yield
but bravely, silently, bore her part
lo, there is that battle field

no marshaling troup, no bivouac song
no banner to gleam or wave
but oh! these battles, they last so long
from babyhood to the grave

yet, faithful as a bridge of stars
she fights in her walled-up town
fights on and on in the endless wars
then, silent, unseen, goes down

oh, ye with banner and battle shot
and soldiers to shout and praise
i tell you the kingliest victories fought
were fought in those silent ways

oh, spotless in a world of shame
with splendid and silent scorn
go back to god as white as you came
the kingliest warrior born



what to a novice she could say
of courtship, love and matrimony
quoth echo plainly,--'matter-o'-money

a dashing damsel, gay and pert
a pattern of inconstancy
or selfish, mercenary flirt
quoth echo, sharply,--'nary flirt

that long has lured the dear deceiver
she promise to amend her life
and sin no more; can i believe her
quoth echo, very promptly;--'leave her

on me should venture to bestow it
pray should i act the wiser part
to take the treasure or forgo it
quoth echo, with decision,--'go it

to bind her fate in hymen's fetter
she vow she means to die a maid
in answer to my loving letter
quoth echo, rather coolly,--'let her

i find my heart entwined about
with cupid's dear, delicious chain
so closely that i can't get out
quoth echo, laughingly,--'get out

as pure and fair as heaven can make her
will share my labor and my rest
till envious death shall overtake her
quoth echo (sotto voce),-'take her



life! i know not what thou art
but know that thou and i must part
and when, or how, or where we met
i own to me's a secret yet

life! we've been long together
through pleasant and through cloudy weather
perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear

then steal away; give little warning
choose thine own time
say not good night, but in some brighter clime
bid me good morning



in the hush and the lonely silence
of the chill october night
some wizard has worked his magic
with fairy fingers light

the leaves of the sturdy oak trees
are splendid with crimson and red
and the golden flags of the maple
are fluttering overhead

through the tangle of faded grasses
there are trailing vines ablaze
and the glory of warmth and color
gleams through the autumn haze

like banners of marching armies
that farther and farther go
down the winding roads and valleys
the boughs of the sumacs glow

so open your eyes, little children
and open your hearts as well
till the charm of the bright october
shall fold you in its spell



not who you are, but what you are
that's what the world demands to know
just what you are, what you can do
to help mankind to live and grow
your lineage matters not at all
nor counts one whit your gold or gear
what can you do to show the world
the reason for your being here

for just what space you occupy
the world requires you pay the rent
it does not shower its gifts galore
its benefits are only lent
and it has need of workers true
willing of hand, alert of brain
go forth and prove what you can do
nor wait to count o'er loss or gain

give of your best to help and cheer
the more you give the more you grow
this message evermore rings true
in time you reap whate'er you sow
no failure you have need to fear
except to fail to do your best
what have you done, what can you do
that is the question, that the test



out of the hills of habersham
down the valleys of hall
i hurry amain to reach the plain
run the rapid and leap the fall
split at the rock and together again
accept my bed, or narrow or wide
and flee from folly on every side
with a lover's pain to attain the plain
far from the hills of habersham
far from the valleys of hall

all down the hills of habersham
all through the valleys of hall
the rushes cried "abide, abide
the wilful waterweeds held me thrall
the laving laurel turned my tide
the ferns and the fondling grass said "stay
the dewberry dipped for to work delay
and the little reeds sighed "abide, abide
here in the hills of habersham
here in the valleys of hall

high o'er the hills of habersham
veiling the valleys of hall
the hickory told me manifold
fair tales of shade, the poplar tall
wrought me her shadowy self to hold
the chestnut, the oak, the walnut, the pine
o'erleaning, with flickering meaning and sign
said, "pass not, so cold, these manifold
deep shades of the hills of habersham
these glades in the valleys of hall

and oft in the hills of habersham
and oft in the valleys of hall
the white quartz shone, and the smooth brookstone
did bar me of passage with friendly brawl
and many a luminous jewel lone
ruby, garnet, and amethyst
made lures with the lights of streaming stone
in the clefts of the hills of habersham
in the beds of the valleys of hall

but oh, not the hills of habersham
and oh, not the valleys of hall
avail: i am fain for to water the plain
downward the voices of duty call
downward, to toil and be mixed with the main
the dry fields burn, and the mills are to turn
and a myriad flowers mortally yearn
and the lordly main from beyond the plain
calls o'er the hills of habersham
calls through the valleys of hall

whichever way the wind doth blow
some heart is glad to have it so
then blow it east, or blow it west
the wind that blows, that wind is best
my little craft sails not alone
a thousand fleets, from every zone
are out upon a thousand seas
and what for me were favoring breeze
might dash another with the shock
of doom upon some hidden rock

i leave it to a higher will
to stay or speed me, trusting still
that all is well, and sure that he
who launched my bark will sail with me
through storm and calm, and will not fail
whatever breezes may prevail
to land me, every peril past
within his haven at the last
then blow it east, or blow it west
the wind that blows, that wind is best




the district school-master was sitting behind his great book-laden desk
close-watching the motions of scholars, pathetic and gay and grotesque
as whisper the half-leafless branches, when autumn's brisk breezes have
his little scrub-thicket of pupils sent upward a half-smothered hum
there was little tom timms on the front seat, whose face was withstanding
a drouth
and jolly jack gibbs just behind him, with a rainy new moon for a mouth
there were both of the smith boys, as studious as if they bore names that
could bloom
and jim jones, a heaven-built mechanic, the slyest young knave in the room
with a countenance grave as a horse's, and his honest eyes fixed on a pin
queer-bent on a deeply-laid project to tunnel joe hawkins's skin
there were anxious young novices, drilling their spelling-books into their
brain
loud-puffing each half-whispered letter, like an engine just starting its
train
there was one fiercely muscular fellow, who scowled at the sums on his
slate
and leered at the innocent figures a look of unspeakable hate
and set his white teeth close together, and gave his thin lips a short
twist
as to say, "i could whip you, confound you! could such things be done with
the fist
there were two knowing girls in the corner, each one with some beauty
possessed
in a whisper discussing the problem which one the young master likes best
a class in the front, with their readers, were telling, with difficult
pains
how perished brave marco bozzaris while bleeding at all of his veins
and a boy on the floor to be punished, a statue of idleness stood
making faces at all of the others, and enjoying the scene all he could


around were the walls, gray and dingy, which every old school-sanctum hath
with many a break on their surface, where grinned a wood-grating of lath
a patch of thick plaster, just over the school-master's rickety chair
seemed threat'ningly o'er him suspended, like damocles' sword, by a hair
there were tracks on the desks where the knife-blades had wandered in
search of their prey
their tops were as duskily spattered as if they drank ink every day
the square stove it puffed and it crackled, and broke out in red flaming
sores
till the great iron quadruped trembled like a dog fierce to rush
out-o'-doors
white snowflakes looked in at the windows; the gale pressed its lips to the
cracks
and the children's hot faces were streaming, the while they were freezing
their backs


now marco bozzaris had fallen, and all of his suff'rings were o'er
and the class to their seats were retreating, when footsteps were heard
at the door
and five of the good district fathers marched into the room in a row
and stood themselves up by the fire, and shook off their white cloaks of
and the spokesman, a grave squire of sixty, with countenance solemnly sad
spoke thus, while the children all listened, with all of the ears that
they had
concernin' complaints that's been entered, an' fault that has lately been
found
to pace off the width of your doin's, an' witness what you've been about
an' see if it's paying to keep you, or whether we'd best turn ye out

you give 'em too tight of a reinin', an' touch 'em up more than they need
you're nicer than wise in the matter of holdin' the book in one han
an' you turn a stray _g_ in their _doin's_, an' tack an odd _d
on their _an
there ain't no great good comes of speakin' the words so polite, as i see
providin' you know what the facts is, an' tell 'em off jest as they be
an' then there's that readin' in corncert, is censured from first unto
it kicks up a heap of a racket, when folks is a-travelin' past
whatever is done as to readin', providin' things go to my say
shan't hang on no new-fangled hinges, but swing in the old-fashioned way
and the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was
and nodded obliquely, and muttered: "them 'ere is my sentiments tew
that you turn the _u_ out o' your _labour_, an' make the word shorter
than 'tis
an' clip the _k_ off yer _musick_, which makes my son ephraim perplexed
an' when he spells out as he ought'r, you pass the word on to the next
they say there's some new-grafted books here that don't take them letters
along
but if it is so, just depend on 't, them new-grafted books is made wrong
you might just as well say that jackson didn't know all there was about
as to say that old spellin'-book webster didn't know what them letters was
and the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was
and scratched their heads slyly and softly, and said: "them's my sentiments
is that you have left tare an' tret out, an' also the old rule o' three
an' likewise brought in a new study, some high-steppin' scholars to please
with saw-bucks an' crosses and pothooks, an' _w's, x's, y's_ an' _z's
we ain't got no time for such foolin'; there ain't no great good to be
reached
by tiptoein' childr'n up higher than ever their fathers was teached
and the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was
and cocked one eye up to the ceiling, and said: "them's my sentiments tew
concernin' some things in the grammar you're teachin' our gals for to say
my gals is as steady as clockwork, and never give cause for much fear
but they come home from school t'other evenin' a-talking such stuff as this
an' 'they
an' they answered my questions: 'it's grammar'--'twas all i could get 'em
to say
now if, 'stead of doin' your duty, you're carryin' matters on so
as to make the gals say that they love you, it's just all that i want to


now jim, the young heaven-built mechanic, in the dusk of the evening
before
had well-nigh unjointed the stovepipe, to make it come down on the floor
and the squire bringing smartly his foot down, as a clincher to what he had
a joint of the pipe fell upon him, and larruped him square on the head
the soot flew in clouds all about him, and blotted with black all the place
and the squire and the other four fathers were peppered with black in the
the school, ever sharp for amusement, laid down all their cumbersome books
and, spite of the teacher's endeavors, laughed loud at their visitors
looks
and the squire, as he stalked to the doorway, swore oaths of a violet hue
and the four district fathers, who followed, seemed to say: "them's my
sentiments tew

the harp that once through tara's halls
the soul of music shed
now hangs as mute on tara's walls
as if that soul were fled
so sleeps the pride of former days
so glory's thrill is o'er
and hearts, that once beat high for praise
now feel that pulse no more

no more to chiefs and ladies bright
the harp of tara swells
the chord alone, that breaks at night
its tale of ruin tells
thus freedom now so seldom wakes
the only throb she gives
is when some heart indignant breaks
to show that still she lives



at paris it was, at the opera there
and she looked like a queen in a book that night
with the wreath of pearl in her raven hair
and the brooch on her breast so bright

of all the operas that verdi wrote
the best, to my taste, is the trovatore
and mario can soothe, with a tenor note
the souls in purgatory

the moon on the tower slept soft as snow
and who was not thrilled in the strangest way
as we heard him sing, while the gas burned low

the emperor there, in his box of state
looked grave, as if he had just then seen
the red flag wave from the city gate
where his eagles in bronze had been

the empress, too, had a tear in her eye
you'd have said that her fancy had gone back again
for one moment, under the old blue sky
to the old glad life in spain

well, there in our front-row box we sat
my gaze was fixed on my opera hat
and hers on the stage hard by

and both were silent, and both were sad
like a queen she leaned on her full white arm
with that regal, indolent air she had
so confident of her charm

i have not a doubt she was thinking then
of her former lord, good soul that he was
who died the richest and roundest of men
the marquis of carabas

i hope that, to get to the kingdom of heaven
through a needle's eye he had not to pass
i wish him well, for the jointure given
to my lady of carabas

meanwhile, i was thinking of my first love
as i had not been thinking of aught for years
till over my eyes there began to move
something that felt like tears

i thought of the dress that she wore last time
when we stood 'neath the cypress trees together
in that lost land, in that soft clime
in the crimson evening weather

of that muslin dress (for the eve was hot
and her warm white neck in its golden chain
and her full soft hair, just tied in a knot
and falling loose again

and the jasmine flower in her fair young breast
and the one bird singing alone to his nest
and the one star over the tower

i thought of our little quarrels and strife
and the letter that brought me back my ring
and it all seemed then, in the waste of life
such a very little thing

for i thought of her grave below the hill
which the sentinel cypress tree stands over
and i thought, "were she only living still
how i could forgive her and love her

and i swear, as i thought of her thus, in that hour
and of how, after all, old things are best
that i smelt the smell of that jasmine flower
which she used to wear in her breast

it smelt so faint, and it smelt so sweet
it made me creep, and it made me cold
like the scent that steals from the crumbling sheet
where a mummy is half unrolled

and i turned and looked: she was sitting there
in a dim box over the stage, and drest
in that muslin dress, with that full, soft hair
and that jasmine in her breast

i was here, and she was there
and the glittering horse-shoe curved between
from my bride betrothed, with her raven hair
and her sumptuous, scornful mien

to my early love, with her eyes downcast
and over her primrose face the shade
there was but a step to be made

to my early love from my future bride
one moment i looked. then i stole to the door
i traversed the passage; and down at her side
i was sitting, a moment more

my thinking of her or the music's strain
or something which never will be exprest
had brought her back from the grave again
with the jasmine in her breast

she is not dead, and she is not wed
but she loves me now, and she loved me then
and the very first word that her sweet lips said
my heart grew youthful again

the marchioness there, of carabas
she is wealthy, and young, and handsome still
and but for her--well, we'll let that pass
she may marry whomever she will

but i will marry my own first love
with her primrose face, for old things are best
and the flower in her bosom, i prize it above
the brooch in my lady's breast

the world is filled with folly and sin
and love must cling where it can, i say
for beauty is easy enough to win
but one isn't loved every day

and i think in the lives of most women and men
there's a moment when all would go smooth and even
if only the dead could find out when
to come back, and be forgiven

but oh the smell of that jasmine flower
and oh, that music! and oh, the way
that voice rang out from the donjon tower




i love my prairies, they are mine
from zenith to horizon line
clipping a world of sky and sod
like the bended arm and wrist of god

i love their grasses. the skies
are larger, and my restless eyes
fasten on more of earth and air
than seashore furnishes anywhere

i love the hazel thickets; and the breeze
the never resting prairie winds. the trees
that stand like spear points high
against the dark blue sky

are wonderful to me. i love the gold
of newly shaven stubble, rolled
a royal carpet toward the sun, fit to be
the pathway of a deity

i love the life of pasture lands; the songs of birds
are not more thrilling to me than the herd's
mad bellowing or the shadow stride
of mounted herdsmen at my side

i love my prairies, they are mine
from high sun to horizon line
the mountains and the cold gray sea
are not for me, are not for me




home they brought her warrior dead
she nor swoon'd, nor utter'd cry
all her maidens, watching, said
then they praised him, soft and low
call'd him worthy to be loved
truest friend and noblest foe
yet she neither spoke nor moved
stole a maiden from her place
lightly to the warrior stept
took the face-cloth from the face
yet she neither moved nor wept
rose a nurse of ninety years
set his child upon her knee
like summer tempest came her tears



sweet is the voice that calls
from babbling waterfalls
in meadows where the downy seeds are flying
and soft the breezes blow
and eddying come and go
in faded gardens where the rose is dying

among the stubbled corn
the blithe quail pipes at morn
the merry partridge drums in hidden places
and glittering insects gleam
above the reedy stream
where busy spiders spin their filmy laces

at eve, cool shadows fall
across the garden wall
and on the clustered grapes to purple turning
and pearly vapors lie
along the eastern sky
where the broad harvest-moon is redly burning

ah, soon on field and hill
the wind shall whistle chill
and patriarch swallows call their flocks together
to fly from frost and snow
and seek for lands where blow
the fairer blossoms of a balmier weather

the cricket chirps all day
the squirrel eyes askance the chestnuts browning
the wild fowl fly afar
above the foamy bar
and hasten southward ere the skies are frowning

now comes a fragrant breeze
through the dark cedar-trees
and round about my temples fondly lingers
in gentle playfulness
like to the soft caress
bestowed in happier days by loving fingers

yet, though a sense of grief
comes with the falling leaf
and memory makes the summer doubly pleasant
in all my autumn dreams
a future summer gleams
passing the fairest glories of the present



far back, in my musings, my thoughts have been cast
to the cot where the hours of my childhood were passed
i loved all its rooms from the pantry to hall
but the blessed old kitchen was dearer than all
its chairs and its tables no brighter could be
and all its surroundings were sacred to me
from the nail in the ceiling to the latch on the door
and i loved every crack in that old kitchen floor

i remember the fireplace with mouth high and wide
and the old-fashioned oven that stood by its side
out of which each thanksgiving came puddings and pies
and they fairly bewildered and dazzled our eyes
and then old st. nicholas slyly and still
came down every christmas our stockings to fill
but the dearest of memories laid up in store
is my mother a-sweeping that old kitchen floor

to-night those old musings come back at their will
but the wheel and its music forever are still
the band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away
and the fingers that turned it are mold'ring in clay
the hearthstone so sacred is just as 'twas then
and the voices of children ring out there again
the sun at the window looks in as of yore
but it sees other feet on that old kitchen floor


the night was dark when sam set out
to court old jones's daughter
he kinder felt as if he must
and kinder hadn't oughter
his heart against his waistcoat throbbed
his feelings had a tussle
which nearly conquered him despite
six feet of bone and muscle

the candle in the window shone
with a most doleful glimmer
and sam he felt his courage ooze
and through his fingers simmer
says he: "now, sam, don't be a fool
take courage, shaking doubter
go on, and pop the question right
for you can't live without her

but still, as he drew near the house
his knees got in a tremble
the beating of his heart ne'er beat
his efforts to dissemble
says he: "now, sam, don't be a goose
and let the female wimmin
knock all your thoughts a-skelter so
and set your heart a-swimmin

so sam, he kinder raised the latch
his courage also raising
and in a moment he sat inside
cid jones's crops a-praising
he tried awhile to talk the farm
in words half dull, half witty
not knowing that old jones well knew
his only thought was--kitty

at last the old folks went to bed
the joneses were but human
old jones was something of a man
and mrs. jones--a woman
and kitty she the pitcher took
and started for the cellar
it wasn't often that she had
so promising a feller

and somehow when she came upstairs
and sam had drank his cider
there seemed a difference in the chairs
and sam was close beside her
his stalwart arm dropped round her waist
her head dropped on his shoulder
and sam--well, he had changed his tune
and grown a trifle bolder

but this, if you live long enough
you surely will discover
there's nothing in this world of ours
except the loved and lover
the morning sky was growing gray
as sam the farm was leaving
his face was surely not the face
of one half grieved, or grieving

and kitty she walked smiling back
with blushing face, and slowly
there's something in the humblest love
that makes it pure and holy
and did he marry her, you ask
she stands there with the ladle
a-skimming of the morning's milk
that's sam who rocks the cradle


the north winds beat and clamor at the door
the drifted snow lies heaped along the street
swept by a blinding storm of hail and sleet
the clouded heavens no guiding starlight lend
but o'er the earth in gloom and darkness bend
gigantic shadows, by the night lamps thrown
dance their weird revels fitfully alone

in lofty halls, where fortune takes its ease
sunk in the treasures of all lands and seas
in happy homes, where warmth and comfort meet
the weary traveler with their smiles to greet
in lowly dwellings, where the needy swarm
round starving embers, chilling limbs to warm
rises the prayer that makes the sad heart light

but hark! above the beating of the storm
peals on the startled ear the fire alarm
yon gloomy heaven's aflame with sudden light
and heart-beats quicken with a strange affright
from tranquil slumbers springs, at duty's call
the ready friend no danger can appall
fierce for the conflict, sturdy, true, and brave
he hurries forth to battle and to save

from yonder dwelling, fiercely shooting out
devouring all they coil themselves about
the flaming furies, mounting high and higher
wrap the frail structure in a cloak of fire
strong arms are battling with the stubborn foe
in vain attempts their power to overthrow
with mocking glee they revel with their prey
defying human skill to check their way

and see! far up above the flame's hot breath
something that's human waits a horrid death
a little child, with waving golden hair
stands, like a phantom, 'mid the horrid glare
her pale, sweet face against the window pressed
while sobs of terror shake her tender breast
and from the crowd beneath, in accents wild
a mother screams, "o god! my child! my child

up goes a ladder. through the startled throng
a hardy fireman swiftly moves along
mounts sure and fast along the slender way
fearing no danger, dreading but delay
the stifling smoke-clouds lower in his path
sharp tongues of flame assail him in their wrath
but up, still up he goes! the goal is won
his strong arm beats the sash, and he is gone

gone to his death. the wily flames surround
and burn and beat his ladder to the ground
in flaming columns move with quickened beat
to rear a massive wall 'gainst his retreat
courageous heart, thy mission was so pure
suffering humanity must thy loss deplore
henceforth with martyred heroes thou shalt live
crowned with all honors nobleness can give

nay, not so fast; subdue these gloomy fears
behold! he quickly on the roof appears
bearing the tender child, his jacket warm
flung round her shrinking form to guard from harm
up with your ladders! quick! 'tis but a chance
behold, how fast the roaring flames advance
quick! quick! brave spirits, to his rescue fly
up! up! by heavens, this hero must not die

silence! he comes along the burning road
bearing, with tender care, his living load
aha! he totters! heaven in mercy save
the good, true heart that can so nobly brave
he's up again! and now he's coming fast
one moment, and the fiery ordeal's passed
and now he's safe! bold flames, ye fought in vain
a happy mother clasps her child again



one bright midsummer day
the gallant steamer ocean queen
swept proudly on her way
bright faces clustered on the deck
or, leaning o'er the side
watched carelessly the feathery foam
that flecked the rippling tide

ah, who beneath that cloudless sky
that smiling bends serene
could dream that danger, awful, vast
impended o'er the scene
could dream that ere an hour had sped
that frame of sturdy oak
would sink beneath the lake's blue waves
blackened with fire and smoke

a seaman sought the captain's side
a moment whispered low
the captain's swarthy face grew pale
he hurried down below
alas, too late! though quick, and sharp
and clear his orders came
no human efforts could avail
to quench th' insidious flame

the bad news quickly reached the deck
it sped from lip to lip
and ghastly faces everywhere
looked from the doomed ship
a hundred lips implore

a sailor, whose heroic soul
that hour should yet reveal
by name john maynard, eastern-born
stood calmly at the wheel
above the smothered roar
make for the nearest shore

no terror pales the helmsman's cheek
or clouds his dauntless eye
as, in a sailor's measured tone
his voice responds, "ay! ay
three hundred souls, the steamer's freight
crowd forward wild with fear
while at the stern the dreaded flames
above the deck appear

john maynard watched the nearing flames
but still with steady hand
he grasped the wheel, and steadfastly
he steered the ship to land
he heard the captain cry
a voice from out the stifling smoke
faintly responds, "ay! ay

but half a mile! a hundred hands
stretch eagerly to shore
but half a mile! that distance sped
peril shall all be o'er
but half a mile! yet stay, the flames
no longer slowly creep
but gather round that helmsman bold
with fierce, impetuous sweep

the captain cries once more
and we shall reach the shore
through flame and smoke that dauntless heart
responded firmly still
unawed, though face to face with death

the flames approach with giant strides
they scorch his hand and brow
one arm, disabled, seeks his side
ah! he is conquered now
but no, his teeth are firmly set
he crushes down his pain
his knee upon the stanchion pressed
he guides the ship again

one moment yet! one moment yet
brave heart, thy task is o'er
the pebbles grate beneath the keel
the steamer touches shore
three hundred grateful voices rise
in praise to god that he
hath saved them from the fearful fire
and from the engulfing sea

but where is he, that helmsman bold
the captain saw him reel
his nerveless hands released their task
he sank beside the wheel
the wave received his lifeless corse
blackened with smoke and fire
god rest him! never hero had
a nobler funeral pyre



piller fights is fun, i tell you
there isn't anything i'd rather do
than get a big piller and hold it tight
stand up in bed and then just fight

us boys allers have our piller fights
and the best night of all is pa's lodge night
soon as ever he goes, we say "good night
then go right upstairs for a piller fight

sometimes maybe ma comes to the stairs
and hollers up, "boys, have you said your prayers
and then george will holler "yes, mamma," for he always has
good deal of preacher about george, pa says

ma says "pleasant dreams," and shuts the door
if she's a-listenin' both of us snore
but as soon as ever she goes we light a light
and pitch right into our piller fight

we play that the bed is bunker hill
and george is americans, so he stands still
but i am the british, so i must hit
as hard as ever i can to make him git
we played buena vista one night
tell you, that was an awful hard fight

held up our pillers like they was a flag
an' hollered, "little more grape-juice, captain bragg
that was the night that george hit the nail
you just ought to have seen those feathers sail

i was covered as white as flour
me and him picked them up for 'most an hour
next day when our ma saw that there mess
she was pretty mad, you better guess

and she told our pa, and he just said
tell you, he whipped us till we were sore
and made us both promise to do it no more

that was a long time ago, and now lodge nights
or when pa's away we have piller fights
but in buena vista george is bound
to see there aren't any nails anywhere 'round

piller fights is fun, i tell you
there isn't anything i'd rather do
than get a big piller and hold it tight
stand up in bed, and then just fight

i sat alone with my conscience
in a place where time had ceased
and we talked of my former living
in the land where the years increased
and i felt i should have to answer
the question it might put to me
and to face the question and answer
throughout an eternity

the ghosts of forgotten actions
came floating before my sight
and things that i thought had perished
were alive with a terrible might
and the vision of life's dark record
was an awful thing to face
alone with my conscience sitting
in that solemnly silent place

and i thought of a far-away warning
of a sorrow that was to be mine
in a land that then was the future
but now is the present time
and i thought of my former thinking
of the judgment day to be
but sitting alone with my conscience
seemed judgment enough for me

and i wondered if there was a future
to this land beyond the grave
but no one gave me an answer
and no one came to save
then i felt that the future was present
and the present would never go by
for it was but the thought of a future
become an eternity

then i woke from my timely dreaming
and the vision passed away
and i knew the far-away warning
was a warning of yesterday
and i pray that i may not forget it
in this land before the grave
that i may not cry out in the future
and no one come to save

i have learned a solemn lesson
which i ought to have known before
and which, though i learned it dreaming
i hope to forget no more

so i sit alone with my conscience
in the place where the years increase
and i try to fathom the future
in the land where time shall cease
and i know of the future judgment
how dreadful soe'er it be
that to sit alone with my conscience
will be judgment enough for me


there's a dandy little fellow
who dresses all in yellow
in yellow with an overcoat of green
with his hair all crisp and curly
in the springtime bright and early
a-tripping o'er the meadow he is seen
through all the bright june weather
like a jolly little tramp
he wanders o'er the hillside, down the road
around his yellow feather
thy gypsy fireflies camp
his companions are the wood lark and the toad

but at last this little fellow
doffs his dainty coat of yellow
and very feebly totters o'er the green
for he very old is growing
and with hair all white and flowing
a-nodding in the sunlight he is seen
oh, poor dandy, once so spandy
golden dancer on the lea
older growing, white hair flowing
poor little baldhead dandy now is he



it's easy to talk of the patience of job, humph! job hed nothin' to try
ef he'd been married to 'bijah brown, folks wouldn't have dared come
nigh him
trials, indeed! now i'll tell you what--ef you want to be sick of your
jest come and change places with me a spell--for i'm an inventor's wife
and such inventions! i'm never sure, when i take up my coffee-pot
that 'bijah hain't been "improvin'" it and it mayn't go off like a shot
why, didn't he make me a cradle once, that would keep itself a-rockin
and didn't it pitch the baby out, and wasn't his head bruised shockin
and there was his "patent peeler," too--a wonderful thing, i'll say
but it hed one fault-it never stopped till the apple was peeled away
as for locks and clocks, and mowin' machines and reapers, and all such
trash
why, 'bijah's invented heaps of 'em but they don't bring in no cash
law! that don't worry him--not at all; he's the most aggravatin'est man
he'll set in his little workshop there, and whistle, and think, and plan
inventin' a jew's-harp to go by steam, or a new-fangled powder-horn
while the children's goin' barefoot to school and the weeds is chokin
our corn
when 'bijah and me kep' company, he warn't like this, you know
our folks all thought he was dreadful smart--but that was years ago
he was handsome as any pictur then, and he had such a glib, bright way
i never thought that a time would come when i'd rue my weddin' day
but when i've been forced to chop wood, and tend to the farm beside
and look at bijah a-settin' there, i've jest dropped down and cried
we lost the hull of our turnip crop while he was inventin' a gun
but i counted it one of my marcies when it bu'st before 'twas done
so he turned it into a "burglar alarm." it ought to give thieves a fright
sometimes i wonder if 'bijah's crazy, he does sech cur'ous things
hev i told you about his bedstead yit?--'twas full of wheels and springs
it hed a key to wind it up, and a clock face at the head
all you did was to turn them hands, and at any hour you said
that bed got up and shook itself, and bounced you on the floor
and then shet up, jest like a box, so you couldn't sleep any more
wa'al, 'bijah he fixed it all complete, and he sot it at half-past five
but he hadn't mor'n got into it when--dear me! sakes alive
them wheels began to whiz and whir! i heered a fearful snap
and there was that bedstead, with 'bijah inside, shet up jest like a trap
i screamed, of course, but 'twan't no use, then i worked that hull long
night
a-trying to open the pesky thing. at last i got in a fright
i couldn't hear his voice inside, and i thought he might be dyin
so i took a crow-bar and smashed it in.--there was 'bijah peacefully
inventin' a way to git out agin. that was all very well to say
but i don't b'lieve he'd have found it out if i'd left him in all day
now, sence i've told you my story, do you wonder i'm tired of life
or think it strange i often wish i warn't an inventor's wife



the snow and the silence came down together
through the night so white and so still
and young folks housed from the bitter weather
housed from the storm and the chill

heard in their dreams the sleigh-bells jingle
coasted the hill-sides under the moon
felt their cheeks with the keen air tingle
skimmed the ice with their steel-clad shoon

they saw the snow when they rose in the morning
glittering ghosts of the vanished night
though the sun shone clear in the winter dawning
and the day with a frosty pomp was bright

out in the clear, cold, winter weather
out in the winter air, like wine
kate with her dancing scarlet feather
bess with her peacock plumage fine

joe and jack with their pealing laughter
frank and tom with their gay hallo
and half a score of roisterers after
out in the witching, wonderful snow

shivering graybeards shuffle and stumble
righting themselves with a frozen frown
grumbling at every snowy tumble
but young folks know why the snow came down



closed eyes can't see the white roses
cold hands can't hold them, you know
breath that is stilled cannot gather
the odors that sweet from them blow
death, with a peace beyond dreaming
its children of earth doth endow
life is the time we can help them
so give them the flowers now

here are the struggles and striving
here are the cares and the tears
now is the time to be smoothing
the frowns and the furrows and fears
what to closed eyes are kind sayings
what to hushed heart is deep vow
naught can avail after parting
so give them the flowers now

just a kind word or a greeting
just a warm grasp or a smile
these are the flowers that will lighten
the burdens for many a mile
after the journey is over
what is the use of them; how
can they carry them who must be carried
oh, give them the flowers now

blooms from the happy heart's garden
plucked in the spirit of love
blooms that are earthly reflections
of flowers that blossom above
words cannot tell what a measure
of blessing such gifts will allow
to dwell in the lives of many
so give them the flowers now




some die too late and some too soon
at early morning, heat of noon
or the chill evening twilight. thou
whom the rich heavens did so endow
with eyes of power and jove's own brow
with all the massive strength that fills
thy home-horizon's granite hills
with rarest gifts of heart and head
from manliest stock inherited
new england's stateliest type of man
in port and speech olympian
whom no one met, at first, but took
a second awed and wondering look
on phidias' unveiled masterpiece
whose words, in simplest home-spun clad
the saxon strength of caedmon's had
with power reserved at need to reach
the roman forum's loftiest speech
sweet with persuasion, eloquent
in passion, cool in argument
or, ponderous, falling on thy foes
as fell the norse god's hammer blows
crushing as if with talus' flail
through error's logic-woven mail
and failing only when they tried
the adamant of the righteous side
thou, foiled in aim and hope, bereaved
of old friends, by the new deceived
too soon for us, too soon for thee
beside thy lonely northern sea
where long and low the marsh-lands spread
laid wearily down thy august head

thou shouldst have lived to feel below
thy feet disunion's fierce upthrow
the late-sprung mine that underlaid
thy sad concessions vainly made
thou shouldst have seen from sumter's wall
the star-flag of the union fall
and armed rebellion pressing on
the broken lines of washington
no stronger voice than thine had then
called out the utmost might of men
to make the union's charter free
and strengthen law by liberty
how had that stern arbitrament
to thy gray age youth's vigor lent
shaming ambition's paltry prize
before thy disillusioned eyes
breaking the spell about thee wound
like the green withes that samson bound
redeeming, in one effort grand
thyself and thy imperiled land
ah cruel fate, that closed to thee
o sleeper by the northern sea
the gates of opportunity
god fills the gaps of human need
each crisis brings its word and deed
wise men and strong we did not lack
but still, with memory turning back
in the dark hours we thought of thee
and thy lone grave beside the sea

above that grave the east winds blow
and from the marsh-lands drifting slow
the sea-fog comes, with evermore
the wave-wash of a lonely shore
and sea-bird's melancholy cry
as nature fain would typify
the sadness of a closing scene
the loss of that which should have been
but, where thy native mountains bare
their foreheads to diviner air
fit emblem of enduring fame
one lofty summit keeps thy name
for thee the cosmic forces did
the rearing of that pyramid
the prescient ages shaping with
fire, flood, and frost thy monolith
sunrise and sunset lay thereon
with hands of light their benison
the stars of midnight pause to set
their jewels in its coronet
and evermore that mountain mass
seems climbing from the shadowy pass
to light, as if to manifest
thy nobler self, they life at best



what flower is this that greets the morn
its hues from heaven so freshly born
with burning star and flaming band
it kindles all the sunset land
o tell us what its name may be
is this the flower of liberty
it is the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty

in savage nature's far abode
its tender seed our fathers sowed
the storm-winds rocked its swelling bud
its opening leaves were streaked with blood
till lo! earth's tyrants shook to see
the full-blown flower of liberty
then hail the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty

behold its streaming rays unite
one mingling flood of braided light
the red that fires the southern rose
with spotless white from northern snows
and, spangled o'er its azure, see
the sister stars of liberty
then hail the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty

the blades of heroes fence it round
where'er it springs is holy ground
from tower and dome its glories spread
it waves where lonely sentries tread
it makes the land as ocean free
and plants an empire on the sea
then hail the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty

thy sacred leaves, fair freedom's flower
shall ever float on dome and tower
to all their heavenly colors true
in blackening frost or crimson dew
and god love us as we love thee
thrice holy flower of liberty
then hail the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty



little lamb, who made thee
dost thou know who made thee
gave thee life, and made thee feed
by the stream and o'er the mead
gave thee clothing of delight
softest clothing, woolly, bright
gave thee such a tender voice
making all the vales rejoice
little lamb, who made thee
dost thou know who made thee

little lamb, i'll tell thee
little lamb, i'll tell thee
he is called by thy name
for he calls himself a lamb
he is meek and he is mild
he became a little child
i a child, and thou a lamb
we are called by his name
little lamb, god bless thee
little lamb, god bless thee



from the lips of the soldier standing near
and "here" was the answer the next replied

this time no answer followed the call
only the rear man had seen him fall
killed or wounded he could not tell

there they stood in the failing light
these men of battle, with grave dark looks
as plain to be read as open books
while slowly gathered the shades of night

the fern on the hillside was splashed with blood
and down in the corn, where the poppies grew
were redder stains than the poppies knew
and crimson-dyed was the river's flood

two stalwart soldiers into the line
bearing between them herbert kline
wounded and bleeding, to answer his name

they were brothers, these two; the sad winds sighed
and a shudder crept through the cornfield near

just after the enemy wavered and broke

i paused a moment and gave him a drink
he murmured his mother's name i think
and death came with it and closed his eyes

for that company's roll when called that night
of a hundred men who went into the fight
numbered but twenty that answered "here



god send us a little home
to come back to when we roam
low walls and fluted tiles
wide windows, a view for miles
red firelight and deep chairs
small white beds upstairs
great talk in little nooks
dim colors, rows of books
one picture on each wall
not many things at all
god send us a little ground
tall trees standing round
homely flowers in brown sod
overhead, thy stars, o god
god bless, when winds blow
our home and all we know



no, comrades, i thank you--not any for me
my last chain is riven--henceforward i'm free
i will go to my home and my children to-night
with no fumes of liquor their spirits to blight
and, with tears in my eyes, i will beg my poor wife
to forgive me the wreck i have made of her life
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass

just look at me now, boys, in rags and disgrace
with my bleared, haggard eyes, and my red, bloated face
mark my faltering step and my weak, palsied hand
and the mark on my brow that is worse than cain's brand
see my crownless old hat, and my elbows and knees
alike, warmed by the sun, or chilled by the breeze
why, even the children will hoot as i pass
but i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass

you would hardly believe, boys, to look at me now
that a mother's soft hand was pressed on my brow
when she kissed me, and blessed me, her darling, her pride
ere she lay down to rest by my dead father's side
but with love in her eyes, she looked up to the sky
bidding me meet her there and whispered "good-bye
and i'll do it, god helping! your _smile_ i let pass
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass

ah! i reeled home last night, it was not very late
for i'd spent my last sixpence, and landlords won't wait
on a fellow who's left every cent in their till
and has pawned his last bed, their coffers to fill
oh, the torments i felt, and the pangs i endured
and i begged for one glass--just one would have cured
but they kicked me out doors! i let that, too, pass
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass

at home, my pet susie, with her rich golden hair
i saw through the window, just kneeling in prayer
from her pale, bony hands, her torn sleeves hung down
and her feet, cold and bare, shrank beneath her scant gown
and she prayed--prayed for _bread_, just a poor crust of bread
for one crust, on her knees my pet darling plead
and i heard, with no penny to buy one, alas
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass

for susie, my darling, my wee six-year-old
though fainting with hunger and shivering with cold
there, on the bare floor, asked god to bless _me
and she said, "don't cry, mamma! he will; for you see
i _believe_ what i ask for!" then sobered, i crept
away from the house; and that night, when i slept
next my heart lay the pledge! you smile! let it pass
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass

my darling child saved me! her faith and her love
are akin to my dear sainted mother's above
i will make my words true, or i'll die in the race
and sober i'll go to my last resting place
and she shall kneel there, and, weeping, thank god
no _drunkard_ lies under the daisy-strewn sod
not a drop more of poison my lips shall e'er pass
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass


ye banks, and braes, and streams around
the castle o' montgomery
green be your woods, and fair your flowers
your waters never drumlie
there simmer first unfauld her robes
and there the langest tarry
for there i took the last fareweel
o' my sweet highland mary

how sweetly bloom'd the gay green birk
how rich the hawthorn's blossom
as, underneath their fragrant shade
i clasp'd her to my bosom
the golden hours, on angel wings
flew o'er me and my dearie
for dear to me as light and life
was my sweet highland mary

wi' mony a vow, and lock'd embrace
our parting was fu' tender
and, pledging aft to meet again
we tore oursels asunder
but, oh, fell death's untimely frost
that nipp'd my flower sae early
now green's the sod and cauld's the clay
that wraps my highland mary

oh, pale, pale now, those rosy lips
i aft ha'e kiss'd, sae fondly
and closed for aye the sparkling glance
that dwalt on me sae kindly
and mouldering now in silent dust
that heart that lo'ed me dearly
but still within my bosom's core
shall live my highland mary



little one, come to my knee
hark, how the rain is pouring
over the roof, in the pitch-black night
and the wind in the woods a-roaring

hush, my darling, and listen
then pay for the story with kisses
father was lost in the pitch-black night
in just such a storm as this is

high up on the lonely mountains
where the wild men watched and waited
wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush
and i on my path belated

the rain and the night together
came down, and the wind came after
bending the props of the pine-tree roof
and snapping many a rafter

i crept along in the darkness
stunned, and bruised, and blinded
crept to a fir with thick-set boughs
and a sheltering rock behind it

there, from the blowing and raining
crouching, i sought to hide me
something rustled, two green eyes shone
and a wolf lay down beside me

little one, be not frightened
i and the wolf together
side by side, through the long, long night
hid from the awful weather

his wet fur pressed against me
each of us warmed the other
each of us felt, in the stormy dark
that beast and man was brother

and when the falling forest
no longer crashed in warning
each of us went from our hiding-place
forth in the wild, wet morning

darling, kiss me in payment
hark, how the wind is roaring
father's house is a better place
when the stormy rain is pouring



she was a phantom of delight
when first she gleamed upon my sight
a lovely apparition sent
to be a moment's ornament
her eyes as stars of twilight fair
like twilight's, too, her dusky hair
but all things else about her drawn
from may-time and the cheerful dawn
a dancing shape, an image gay
to haunt, to startle, and way-lay

i saw her upon nearer view
a spirit, yet a woman too
her household motions light and free
and steps of virgin-liberty
a countenance in which did meet
sweet records, promises as sweet
a creature not too bright or good
for human nature's daily food
for transient sorrows, simple wiles
praise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles

and now i see with eye serene
the very pulse of the machine
a being breathing thoughtful breath
a traveler between life and death
the reason firm, the temperate will
endurance, foresight, strength, and skill
a perfect woman, nobly planned
to warn, to comfort, and command
and yet a spirit still, and bright
with something of angelic light




in may, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes
i found the fresh rhodora in the woods
spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook
to please the desert and the sluggish brook
the purple petals, fallen in the pool
made the black water with their beauty gay
here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool
and court the flower that cheapens his array
rhodora! if the sages ask thee why
this charm is wasted on the earth and sky
tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing
then beauty is its own excuse for being
why thou wert there, o rival of the rose
i never thought to ask, i never knew
but, in my simple ignorance, suppose
the self-same power that brought me there brought you



there was a boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs
and islands of winander!--many a time
at evening, when the earliest stars began
to move along the edges of the hills
rising or setting, would he stand alone
beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake
and there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth
uplifted, he, as through an instrument
blew mimic hootings to the silent owls
that they might answer him,--and they would shout
across the watery vale, and shout again
responsive to his call,--with quivering peals
and long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud
redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild
of jocund din! and, when there came a pause
of silence such as baffled his best skill
then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung
listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise
has carried far into his heart the voice
of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene
would enter unawares into his mind
with all its solemn imagery, its rocks
its woods, and that uncertain heaven received
into the bosom of the steady lake
this boy was taken from his mates, and died
in childhood, ere he was full twelve years old
pre-eminent in beauty is the vale
where he was born and bred: the church-yard hangs
upon a slope above the village-school
and through that church-yard when my way has led
on summer-evenings, i believe, that there
a long half-hour together i have stood
mute--looking at the grave in which he lies



on the top of the crumpetty tree
the quangle wangle sat
but his face you could not see
on account of his beaver hat
for his hat was a hundred and two feet wide
with ribbons and bibbons on every side
and bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace
so that nobody ever could see the face
of the quangle wangle quee

the quangle wangle said
to himself on the crumpetty tree
are the best of food for me
but the longer i live on this crumpetty tree
the plainer than ever it seems to me
that very few people come this way
and that life on the whole is far from gay
said the quangle wangle quee

but there came to the crumpetty tree
mr. and mrs. canary
and they said, "did ever you see
any spot so charmingly airy
may we build a nest on your lovely hat
mr. quangle wangle, grant us that
oh, please let us come and build a nest
of whatever material suits you best
mr. quangle wangle quee

and besides, to the crumpetty tree
came the stork, the duck, and the owl
the snail and the bumblebee
the frog and the fimble fowl
and all of them said, "we humbly beg
we may build our homes on your lovely hat
mr. quangle wangle, grant us that
mr. quangle wangle quee

and the golden grouse came there
and the pobble who has no toes
and the small olympian bear
and the dong with a luminous nose
and the blue baboon who played the flute
and the orient calf from the land of tute
and the attery squash, and the bisky bat
all came and built on the lovely hat
of the quangle wangle quee

and the quangle wangle said
to himself on the crumpetty tree
what a wonderful noise there'll be
and at night by the light of the mulberry moon
they danced to the flute of the blue baboon
on the broad green leaves of the crumpetty tree
and all were as happy as happy could be
with the quangle wangle quee




said the king to his daughters three
now say what shall they be

then up and spake the eldest daughter
that lady tall and grand
and gold rings for my hand

thereafter spake the second daughter
that was both white and red
and a gold comb for my head

then came the turn of the least daughter
that was whiter than thistle-down
and among the gold of her blithesome hair
dim shone the golden crown

and sang 'neath my bower eaves
till i dreamed, as his music made me

then the brow of the king swelled crimson
with a flush of angry scorn
and chosen as ye were born

that is happy binding the sheaves
then he saw her dead mother in her face
and said, "thou shalt have thy leaves


he mounted and rode three days and nights
till he came to vanity fair
and 'twas easy to buy the gems and the silk
but no singing leaves were there

then deep in the greenwood rode he
and asked of every tree
i pray you give it me

but the trees all kept their counsel
and never a word said they
only there sighed from the pine-tops
a music of seas far away

only the pattering aspen
made a sound of growing rain
that fell ever faster and faster
then faltered to silence again

that would win both hose and shoon
and will bring to me the singing leaves
if they grow under the moon

then lightly turned him walter the page
by the stirrup as he ran
of a king and gentleman

you meet at your castle-gate
and the princess shall get the singing leaves
or mine be a traitor's fate

the king's head dropt upon his breast
a moment, as it might be

then walter took from next his heart
a packet small and thin
the singing leaves are therein


as the king rode in at his castle-gate
a maiden to meet him ran
and "welcome, father!" she laughed and cried
together, the princess anne

she took the packet, and the smile
deepened down beneath the tear

it deepened down till it reached her heart
and then gushed up again
and lighted her tears as the sudden sun
transfigures the summer rain

and the first leaf, when it was opened
sang: "i am walter the page
and the songs i sing 'neath thy window
are my only heritage

and the second leaf sang: "but in the land
that is neither on earth nor sea
my lute and i are lords of more
than thrice this kingdom's fee

and the third leaf sang, "be mine! be mine
and ever it sang, "be mine
then sweeter it sang and ever sweeter
and said, "i am thine, thine, thine

at the first leaf she grew pale enough
at the second she turned aside
at the third,'twas as if a lily flushed
with a rose's red heart's tide

for they sing to my very heart," she said

she brought to him her beauty and truth
but and broad earldoms three
and he made her queen of the broader lands
he held of his lute in fee



never yet was a springtime
late though lingered the snow
that the sap stirred not at the whisper
of the south wind, sweet and low
never yet was a springtime
when the buds forgot to blow

ever the wings of the summer
are folded under the mold
life that has known no dying
is love's to have and to hold
till sudden, the burgeoning easter
the song! the green and the gold




farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness
this is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
the tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms
and bears his blushing honours thick upon him
the third day comes a frost, a killing frost
and,--when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
his greatness is a-ripening,--nips his root
and then he falls, as i do. i have ventured
like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
this many summers in a sea of glory
but far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
at length broke under me, and now has left me
weary, and old with service, to the mercy
of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me
vain pomp and glory of this world, i hate ye
i feel my heart new opened. o, how wretched
is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours
there is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to
that sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
more pangs and fears than wars or women have
and when he falls, he falls like lucifer
never to hope again



want any papers, mister
wish you'd buy 'em of me
ten year old, an' a fam'ly
an' bizness dull, you see
fact, boss! there's tom, an' tibby

and put for home, right strong

and tom's my dog; he an' tibby

but if i do git rich, boss

i'd buy poor tom an' tibby
a dinner--an' mam's cat, too

if you think i'd skimp my friends, boss
that shows you don't know _me
so 'ere's your papers--come take one
gimme a lift if you can
for now you've heard my story
you see i'm a fam'ly man



not far advanced was morning day
when marmion did his troop array
to surrey's camp to ride
he had safe conduct for his band
beneath the royal seal and hand
and douglas gave a guide
the ancient earl, with stately grace
would clara on her palfrey place
and whispered in an undertone
the train from out the castle drew
but marmion stopped to bid adieu
sent hither by your king's behest
while in tantallon's towers i stayed
part we in friendship from your land
and, noble earl, receive my hand
but douglas round him drew his cloak
folded his arms, and thus he spoke
be open, at my sovereign's will
to each one whom he lists, howe'er
unmeet to be the owner's peer
my castles are my king's alone
from turret to foundation-stone
the hand of douglas is his own
and never shall in friendly grasp
the hand of such as marmion clasp

burned marmion's swarthy cheek like fire
and shook his very frame for ire
and--"this to me!" he said
such hand as marmion's had not spared
to cleave the douglas' head
and, first, i tell thee, haughty peer
he who does england's message here
even in thy pitch of pride
here in thy hold, thy vassals near
and lay your hands upon your sword
i tell thee thou'rt defied
and if thou said'st i am not peer
to any lord in scotland here
lowland or highland, far or near
lord angus, thou hast lied
on the earl's cheek the flush of rage
o'ercame the ashen hue of age
fierce he broke forth,--"and dar'st thou then
to beard the lion in his den
the douglas in his hall
and hop'st thou hence unscathed to go
no, by st. bride of bothwell, no
up drawbridge, grooms,--what, warder, ho
let the portcullis fall
lord marmion turned,--well was his need
and dashed the rowels in his steed
like arrow through the archway sprung
the ponderous grate behind him rung
to pass there was such scanty room
the bars, descending, razed his plume

the steed along the drawbridge flies
just as it trembled on the rise
not lighter does the swallow skim
along the smooth lake's level brim
and when lord marmion reached his band
he halts, and turns with clenched hand
and shout of loud defiance pours
and shook his gauntlet at the towers
but soon he reined his fury's pace
though most unworthy of the name

old age ne'er cools the douglas blood
i thought to slay him where he stood
i warrant him a warrior tried
with this his mandate he recalls
and slowly seeks his castle halls



han'som, stranger? yes, she's purty an' ez peart ez she kin be
clever? w'y! she ain't no chicken, but she's good enough for me
what's her name? 'tis kind o' common, yit i ain't ashamed to tell
she's ole "fiddler" filkin's daughter, an' her dad he calls her "nell

i wuz drivin' on the "central" jist about a year ago
on the run from winnemucca up to reno in washoe
there's no end o' skeery places. 'taint a road fur one who dreams
with its curves an' awful tres'les over rocks an' mountain streams

an' wuz tearin' up the mountain like a summer thunder-shower
round the bends an' by the ledges, 'bout ez fast ez we could go
with the mountain peaks above us an' the river down below

ez we come nigh to a tres'le 'crost a holler, deep an' wild
suddenly i saw a baby, 'twuz the station-keeper's child
toddlin' right along the timbers with a bold an' fearless tread
right afore the locomotive, not a hundred rods ahead

i jist jumped an' grabbed the throttle an' i fa'rly held my breath
fur i felt i couldn't stop her till the child wuz crushed to death
when a woman sprang afore me, like a sudden streak o' light
caught the boy, an' 'twixt the timbers in a second sank from sight

i jist whis'l'd all the brakes on. an' we worked with might an' main
till the fire flew from the drivers, but we couldn't stop the train
an' it rumbled on above her. how she screamed ez we rolled by
an' the river roared below us--i shall hear her till i die

then we stopt; the sun wuz shinin'; i ran back along the ridge
an' i found her--dead? no! livin'! she wuz hangin' to the bridge
where she dropt down thro' the crossties, with one arm about a sill
an' the other round the baby, who wuz yellin' fur to kill

so we saved 'em. she wuz gritty. she's ez peart ez she kin be
now we're married--she's no chicken, but she's good enough for me
an' ef eny ask who owns her, w'y, i ain't ashamed to tell
she's my wife. ther' ain't none better than ole filkin's daughter "nell



a traveler on the dusty road
strewed acorns on the lea
and one took root and sprouted up
and grew into a tree
love sought its shade, at evening time
to breathe his early vows
and age was pleased, in heats of noon
to bask beneath its boughs
the dormouse loved its dangling twigs
the birds sweet music bore
it stood a glory in its place
a blessing evermore

a little spring had lost its way
amid the grass and fern
a passing stranger scooped a well
where weary men might turn
he walled it in, and hung with care
a ladle at the brink
he thought not of the deed he did
but judged that all might drink
he paused again, and lo! the well
by summer never dried
had cooled ten thousand parching tongues
and saved a life beside

a dreamer dropped a random thought
a simple fancy of the brain
but strong in being true
it shone upon a genial mind
and, lo! its light became
a lamp of life, a beacon ray
a monitory flame
the thought was small, its issue great
a watch-fire on the hill
it shed its radiance far adown
and cheers the valley still

a nameless man, amid a crowd
that thronged the daily mart
let fall a word of hope and love
unstudied from the heart
a whisper on the tumult thrown
a transitory breath
it raised a brother from the dust
it saved a soul from death
o germ! o fount! o word of love
o thought at random cast
ye were but little at the first
but mighty at the last



when the humid showers gather over all the starry spheres
and the melancholy darkness gently weeps in rainy tears
and listen to the patter of the soft rain overhead

every tinkle on the shingles has an echo in the heart
and a thousand dreamy fancies into busy being start
and a thousand recollections weave their bright hues into woof
as i listen to the patter of the soft rain on the roof

there in fancy comes my mother, as she used to years agone
to survey the infant sleepers ere she left them till the dawn
i can see her bending o'er me, as i listen to the strain
which is played upon the shingles by the patter of the rain

then my little seraph sister, with her wings and waving hair
and her bright-eyed, cherub brother--a serene, angelic pair
glide around my wakeful pillow with their praise or mild reproof
as i listen to the murmur of the soft rain on the roof

and another comes to thrill me with her eyes' delicious blue
i forget, as gazing on her, that her heart was all untrue
i remember that i loved her as i ne'er may love again
and my heart's quick pulses vibrate to the patter of the rain

there is naught in art's bravuras that can work with such a spell
in the spirit's pure, deep fountains, whence the holy passions swell
as that melody of nature, that subdued, subduing strain
which is played upon the shingles by the patter of the rain



the "bhisti," or water-carriers attached to regiments in india, is often
one of the most devoted subjects of the british crown, and he is much
appreciated by the men

you may talk o' gin an' beer
when you're quartered safe out 'ere
an' you're sent to penny-fights an' aldershot it
but if it comes to slaughter
you will do your work on water
an' you'll lick the bloomin' boots of 'im that's got it
now in injia's sunny clime
where i used to spend my time
a-servin' of 'er majesty the queen
of all them black-faced crew
the finest man i knew
was our regimental _bhisti_, gunga din
he was "din! din! din
you limping lump o' brick-dust, gunga din
hi! _slippy hitherao
water, get it! _panee lao
you squidgy-nosed, old idol, gunga din

the uniform 'e wore
was nothin' much before
an' rather less than 'arf o' that be'ind
for a twisty piece o' rag
an' a goatskin water bag
was all the field-equipment 'e could find
when the sweatin' troop-train lay
in a sidin' through the day
where the 'eat would make your bloomin' eyebrows crawl
we shouted "harry by
till our throats were bricky-dry
then we wopped 'im 'cause 'e couldn't serve us all
it was "din! din! din
you 'eathen, where the mischief 'ave you been
you put some _juldee_ in it
or i'll _marrow_ you this minute
if you don't fill up my helmet, gunga din

till the longest day was done
an' 'e didn't seem to know the use o' fear
if we charged or broke or cut
you could bet your bloomin' nut
with 'is _mussick_ on 'is back
an' watch us till the bugles made "retire
an' for all 'is dirty 'ide
when 'e went to tend the wounded under fire
it was "din! din! din
with the bullets kickin' dust-spots on the green
when the cartridges ran out
you could 'ear the front-files shout

i sha'n't forgit the night
when i dropped be'ind the fight
with a bullet where my belt-plate should 'a' been
i was chokin' mad with thirst
an' the man that spied me first
was our good old grinnin', gruntin' gunga din
an' 'e plugged me where i bled
an' 'e guv me arf-a-pint o' water--green
it was crawlin' and it stunk
but of all the drinks i've drunk
i'm gratefullest to one from gunga din
it was "din! din! din
for gawd's sake git the water, gunga din

to where a _dooli_ lay
an' a bullet come an' drilled the beggar clean
an', just before 'e died
so i'll meet 'im later on
in the place where 'e is gone
where it's always double drill and no canteen
givin' drink to pore damned souls
an' i'll get a swig in hell from gunga din
din! din! din
you lazarushian-leather gunga din
tho' i've belted you an' flayed you
by the livin' gawd that made you
you're a better man than i am, gunga din









stand! the ground's your own, my braves
will ye give it up to slaves
will ye look for greener graves
hope ye mercy still
what's the mercy despots feel
hear it in that battle peal
read it on yon bristling steel
ask it--ye who will

fear ye foes who kill for hire
will ye to your homes retire
look behind you! they're afire
and, before you, see
who have done it! from the vale
on they come! and will ye quail
leaden rain and iron hail
let their welcome be

in the god of battles trust
die we may--and die we must
but, o where can dust to dust
be consigned so well
as where heaven its dews shall shed
on the martyred patriot's bed
and the rocks shall raise their head
of his deeds to tell





why dost thou wildly rush and roar
mad river, o mad river
wilt thou not pause and cease to pour
thy hurrying, headlong waters o'er
this rocky shelf forever

what secret trouble stirs thy breast
why all this fret and flurry
dost thou not know that what is best
in this too restless world is rest
from overwork and worry


what wouldst thou in these mountains seek
o stranger from the city
is it perhaps some foolish freak
of thine, to put the words i speak
into a plaintive ditty


yes; i would learn of thee thy song
with all its flowing numbers
and in a voice as fresh and strong
as thine is, sing it all day long
and hear it in my slumbers


a brooklet nameless and unknown
was i at first, resembling
a little child, that all alone
comes venturing down the stairs of stone
irresolute and trembling

later, by wayward fancies led
for the wide world i panted
out of the forest dark and dread
across the open fields i fled
like one pursued and haunted

i tossed my arms, i sang aloud
my voice exultant blending
with thunder from the passing cloud
the wind, the forest bent and bowed
the rush of rain descending

i heard the distant ocean call
imploring and entreating
drawn onward, o'er this rocky wall
i plunged, and the loud waterfall
made answer to the greeting

and now, beset with many ills
a toilsome life i follow
compelled to carry from the hills
these logs to the impatient mills
below there in the hollow

yet something ever cheers and charms
the rudeness of my labors
daily i water with these arms
the cattle of a hundred farms
and have the birds for neighbors

men call me mad, and well they may
when, full of rage and trouble
i burst my banks of sand and clay
and sweep their wooden bridge away
like withered reeds or stubble

now go and write thy little rhyme
as of thine own creating
thou seest the day is past its prime
i can no longer waste my time
the mills are tired of waiting



when papa was a little boy you really couldn't find
in all the country round about a child so quick to mind
his mother never called but once, and he was always there
he never made the baby cry or pulled his sister's hair
he never slid down banisters or made the slightest noise
and never in his life was known to fight with other boys
he always rose at six o'clock and went to bed at eight
and never lay abed till noon; and never sat up late

he finished latin, french and greek when he was ten year old
and knew the spanish alphabet as soon as he was told
he never, never thought of play until his work was done
he labored hard from break of day until the set of sun
he never scraped his muddy shoes upon the parlor floor
and never answered, back his ma, and never banged the door



i looked at john,--john looked at me
as well as though my locks were jet
and when i found that i must speak
my voice seemed strangely low and weak
and then i listening bent my head
a house and land while you shall live
if, in return, from out your seven
one child to me for aye is given

i looked at john's old garments worn
i thought of all that john had borne
of poverty, and work, and care
which i, though willing, could not share
of seven hungry mouths to feed
of seven little children's need
and then of this
asleep"; so walking hand in hand
dear john and i surveyed our band

first to the cradle lightly stepped
where lilian, the baby, slept
her damp curls lay, like gold alight
a glory 'gainst the pillow white
softly her father stooped to lay
his rough hand down in loving way
when dream or whisper made her stir
and huskily he said, "not _her
we stooped beside the trundle-bed
and one long ray of lamp-light shed
athwart the boyish faces there
in sleep so pitiful and fair
i saw on jamie's rough red cheek
a tear undried; ere john could speak
and kissed him as we hurried by
pale, patient robby's angel face
still in his sleep bore suffering's trace
he whispered, while our eyes were dim
poor dick! sad dick! our wayward son
turbulent, reckless, idle one
could _he_ be spared? "nay, he who gave
bids us befriend him to the grave
only a mother's heart can be
patient enough for such as he
and so," said john, "i would not dare
to send him from her bedside prayer
then stole we softly up above
and knelt by mary, child of love
i said to john. quite silently
he lifted up a curl, that lay
across her cheek in wilful way
and shook his head; "nay, love, not thee
the while my heart beat audibly
only one more, our eldest lad
trusty and truthful, good and glad
so like his father: "no, john, no
i cannot, will not, let him go

and so we wrote, in courteous way
we could not give one child away
and afterward toil lighter seemed
thinking of that of which we dreamed
happy, in truth, that not one face
we missed from its accustomed place
thankful to work for all the seven
trusting then to one in heaven



it was a starry night in june, the air was soft and still
when the "minute-men" from cambridge came, and gathered on the hill
beneath us lay the sleeping town, around us frowned the fleet
but the pulse of freemen, not of slaves, within our bosoms beat
and every heart rose high with hope, as fearlessly we said

the trench is marked, the tools are brought, we utter not a word
but stack our guns, then fall to work with mattock and with spade
a thousand men with sinewy arms, and not a sound is made
so still were we, the stars beneath, that scarce a whisper fell
we heard the red-coat's musket click, and heard him cry, "all's well

see how the morn, is breaking; the red is in the sky
the mist is creeping from the stream that floats in silence by
the "lively's" hall looms through the fog, and they our works have spied
for the ruddy flash and round-shot part in thunder from her side
and the "falcon" and the "cerberus" make every bosom thrill
with gun and shell, and drum and bell, and boatswain's whistle shrill
but deep and wider grows the trench, as spade and mattock ply
for we have to cope with fearful odds, and the time is drawing nigh

up with the pine-tree banner! our gallant prescott stands
amid the plunging shells and shot, and plants it with his hands
up with the shout! for putnam comes upon his reeking bay
with bloody spur and foaming bit, in haste to join the fray
but thou whose soul is glowing in the summer of thy years
unvanquishable warren, thou, the youngest of thy peers
wert born and bred, and shaped and made, to act a patriot's part
and dear to us thy presence is as heart's blood to the heart

hark! from the town a trumpet! the barges at the wharf
are crowded with the living freight; and now they're pushing off
with clash and glitter, trump and drum, in all its bright array
behold the splendid sacrifice move slowly o'er the bay
and still and still the barges fill, and still across the deep
like thunder clouds along the sky, the hostile transports sweep

and now they're forming at the point; and now the lines advance
we see beneath the sultry sun their polished bayonets glance
we hear anear the throbbing drum, the bugle-challenge ring
quick bursts and loud the flashing cloud, and rolls from wing to wing
but on the height our bulwark stands, tremendous in its gloom
as sullen as a tropic sky, and silent as a tomb

and so we waited till we saw, at scarce ten rifles' length
the old vindictive saxon spite, in all its stubborn strength
when sudden, flash on flash, around the jagged rampart burst
from every gun the livid light upon the foe accursed
then quailed a monarch's might before a free-born people's ire
then drank the sward the veteran's life, where swept the yeoman's fire

then, staggered by the shot, he saw their serried columns reel
and fall, as falls the bearded rye beneath the reaper's steel
and then arose a mighty shout that might have waked the dead
and every man hath dropped his gun to clutch a neighbor's hand
as his heart kept praying all the while for home and native land

thrice on that day we stood the shock of thrice a thousand foes
and thrice that day within our lines the shout of victory rose
and though our swift fire slackened then, and, reddening in the skies
we saw from charlestown's roofs and walls the flamy columns rise
yet while we had a cartridge left, we still maintained the fight
nor gained the foe one foot of ground upon that blood-stained height

what though for us no laurels bloom, and o'er the nameless brave
no sculptured trophy, scroll, nor hatch records a warrior grave
what though the day to us was lost!--upon that deathless page
the everlasting charter stands for every land and age

for man hath broke his felon bonds, and cast them in the dust
and claimed his heritage divine, and justified the trust
while through his rifted prison-bars the hues of freedom pour
o'er every nation, race and clime, on every sea and shore
such glories as the patriarch viewed, when, mid the darkest skies
he saw above a ruined world the bow of promise rise



we squander health in search of wealth
we scheme and toil and save
then squander wealth in search of health
but only find a grave
we live, and boast of what we own
we die, and only get a stone


it may be that the words i spoke
to cheer him on his way
to him were vain, but i myself
was braver all that day



billy's dead, and gone to glory--so is billy's sister nell
there's a tale i know about them, were i poet i would tell
soft it comes, with perfume laden, like a breath of country air
wafted down the filthy alley, bringing fragrant odors there

in that vile and filthy alley, long ago one winter's day
dying quick of want and fever, hapless, patient billy lay
while beside him sat his sister, in the garret's dismal gloom
cheering with her gentle presence billy's pathway to the tomb

many a tale of elf and fairy did she tell the dying child
till his eyes lost half their anguish, and his worn, wan features smiled
tales herself had heard haphazard, caught amid the babel roar
lisped about by tiny gossips playing round their mothers' door

then she felt his wasted fingers tighten feebly as she told
how beyond this dismal alley lay a land of shining gold
where, when all the pain was over,--where, when all the tears were shed
he would be a white-frocked angel, with a gold thing on his head

then she told some garbled story of a kind-eyed saviour's love
how he'd built for little children great big playgrounds up above
where they sang and played at hopscotch and at horses all the day
and where beadles and policemen never frightened them away

this was nell's idea of heaven,--just a bit of what she'd heard
with a little bit invented, and a little bit inferred
but her brother lay and listened, and he seemed to understand
for he closed his eyes and murmured he could see the promised land

oh, the children look so happy and they're all so strong and well
i can see them there with jesus--he is playing with them, too
let as run away and join them, if there's room for me and you

she was eight, this little maiden, and her life had all been spent
in the garret and the alley, where they starved to pay the rent
where a drunken father's curses and a drunken mother's blows
drove her forth into the gutter from the day's dawn to its close

but she knew enough, this outcast, just to tell this sinking boy
you must die," she whispered, "billy, and i am not even ill
but i'll come to you, dear brother,--yes, i promise that i will

i heard father say to mother that he knew you couldn't last
they will put you in a coffin, then you'll wake and be up there
while i'm left alone to suffer in this garret bleak and bare

gentle jesus will not beat me; he's not cruel or unkind
but i can't help thinking, nelly, i should like to take away
something, sister, that you gave me, i might look at every day

to a great green lovely meadow, where we played and ran about
and the van that took us halted by a sweet bright patch of land
where the fine red blossoms grew, dear, half as big as mother's hand

those
and he told me, i remember, that the pretty name was rose
i have never seen them since, dear--how i wish that i had one
just to keep and think of you, nell, when i'm up beyond the sun

not a word said little nelly; but at night, when billy slept
on she flung her scanty garments and then down the stairs she crept
through the silent streets of london she ran nimbly as a fawn
running on and running ever till the night had changed to dawn

when the foggy sun had risen, and the mist had cleared away
all around her, wrapped in snowdrift, there the open country lay
she was tired, her limbs were frozen, and the roads had cut her feet
but there came no flowery gardens her poor tearful eyes to greet

she had traced the road by asking, she had learnt the way to go
she had found the famous meadow--it was wrapped in cruel snow
not a buttercup or daisy, not a single verdant blade
showed its head above its prison. then she knelt her down and prayed

with her eyes upcast to heaven, down she sank upon the ground
and she prayed to god to tell her where the roses might be found
then the cold blast numbed her senses, and her sight grew strangely dim
and a sudden, awful tremor seemed to seize her every limb

and as she prayed a chariot came thundering down the hill
and a lady sat there, toying with a red rose, rare and sweet
as she passed she flung it from her, and it fell at nelly's feet

just a word her lord had spoken caused her ladyship to fret
and the rose had been his present, so she flung it in a pet
but the poor, half-blinded nelly thought it fallen from the skies
and she murmured, "thank you, jesus!" as she clasped the dainty prize

lo! that night from but the alley did a child's soul pass away
from dirt and sin and misery up to where god's children play
lo! that night a wild, fierce snowstorm burst in fury o'er the land
and at morn they found nell frozen, with the red rose in her hand

billy's dead, and gone to glory--so is billy's sister nell
am i bold to say this happened in the land where angels dwell
that the children met in heaven, after all their earthly woes
and that nelly kissed her brother, and said, "billy, here's your rose



mine is a wild, strange story,--the strangest you ever heard
there are many who won't believe it, but it's gospel, every word
it's the biggest drama of any in a long, adventurous life
the scene was a ship, and the actors--were myself and my new-wed wife

you musn't mind if i ramble, and lose the thread now and then
i'm old, you know, and i wander--it's a way with old women and men
for their lives lie all behind them, and their thoughts go far away
and are tempted afield, like children lost on a summer day

the years must be five-and-twenty that have passed since that awful night
but i see it again this evening, i can never shut out the sight
we were only a few weeks married, i and the wife, you know
when we had an offer for melbourne, and made up our minds to go

we'd acted together in england, traveling up and down
with a strolling band of players, going from town to town
we played the lovers together--we were leading lady and gent
and at last we played in earnest, and straight to the church we went

the parson gave us his blessing, and i gave nellie the ring
and swore that i'd love and cherish, and endow her with everything
how we smiled at that part of the service when i said "i thee endow
but as to the "love and cherish," i meant to keep that vow

we were only a couple of strollers; we had coin when the show was good
when it wasn't we went without it, and we did the best we could
we were happy, and loved each other, and laughed at the shifts we made
where love makes plenty of sunshine, there poverty casts no shade

well, at last we got to london, and did pretty well for a bit
then the business dropped to nothing, and the manager took a flit
stepped off one sunday morning, forgetting the treasury call
but our luck was in, and we managed right on our feet to fall

we got an offer for melbourne,--got it that very week
those were the days when thousands went over to fortune seek
the days of the great gold fever, and a manager thought the spot
good for a "spec," and took us as actors among his lot

we hadn't a friend in england--we'd only ourselves to please
and we jumped at the chance of trying our fortune across the seas
we went on a sailing vessel, and the journey was long and rough
we hadn't been out a fortnight before we had had enough

but use is a second nature, and we'd got not to mind a storm
when misery came upon us,--came in a hideous form
my poor little wife fell ailing, grew worse, and at last so bad
that the doctor said she was dying,--i thought 'twould have sent me mad

dying where leagues of billows seemed to shriek for their prey
and the nearest land was hundreds--aye, thousands--of miles away
she raved one night in a fever, and the next lay still as death
so still i'd to bend and listen for the faintest sign of breath

she seemed in a sleep, and sleeping, with a smile on her thin, wan face
she passed away one morning, while i prayed to the throne of grace
i knelt in the little cabin, and prayer after prayer i said
till the surgeon came and told me it was useless--my wife was dead

dead! i wouldn't believe it. they forced me away that night
for i raved in my wild despairing, the shock sent me mad outright
i was shut in the farthest cabin, and i beat my head on the side
and all day long in my madness, "they've murdered her!" i cried

they locked me away from my fellows,--put me in cruel chains
it seems i had seized a weapon to beat out the surgeon's brains
i cried in my wild, mad fury, that he was a devil sent
to gloat o'er the frenzied anguish with which my heart was rent

i spent that night with the irons heavy upon my wrists
and my wife lay dead quite near me. i beat with my fettered fists
beat at my prison panels, and then--o god!--and then
i heard the shrieks of women and the tramp of hurrying men

i heard the cry, "ship afire!" caught up by a hundred throats
and over the roar the captain shouting to lower the boats
then cry upon cry, and curses, and the crackle of burning wood
and the place grew hot as a furnace, i could feel it where i stood

i beat at the door and shouted, but never a sound came back
and the timbers above me started, till right through a yawning crack
i could see the flames shoot upward, seizing on mast and sail
fanned in their burning fury by the breath of the howling gale

i dashed at the door in fury, shrieking, "i will not die
die in this burning prison!"--but i caught no answering cry
then, suddenly, right upon me, the flames crept up with a roar
and their fiery tongues shot forward, cracking my prison door

i was free--with the heavy iron door dragging me down to death
i fought my way to the cabin, choked with the burning breath
of the flames that danced around me like man-mocking fiends at play
and then--o god! i can see it, and shall to my dying day

there lay my nell as they'd left her, dead in her berth that night
the flames flung a smile on her features,--a horrible, lurid light
god knows how i reached and touched her, but i found myself by her side
i thought she was living a moment, i forgot that my nell had died

in the shock of those awful seconds reason came back to my brain
i heard a sound as of breathing, and then a low cry of pain
oh, was there mercy in heaven? was there a god in the skies
the dead woman's lips were moving, the dead woman opened her eyes

i cursed like a madman raving--i cried to her, "nell! my nell
they had left us alone and helpless, alone in that burning hell
they had left us alone to perish--forgotten me living--and she
had been left for the fire to bear her to heaven, instead of the sea

i clutched at her, roused her shrieking, the stupor was on her still
i seized her in spite of my fetters,--fear gave a giant's will
god knows how i did it, but blindly i fought through the flames and the
wreck
up--up to the air, and brought her safe to the untouched deck

we'd a moment of life together,--a moment of life, the time
for one last word to each other,--'twas a moment supreme, sublime
from the trance we'd for death mistaken, the heat had brought her to life
and i was fettered and helpless, so we lay there, husband and wife

it was but a moment, but ages seemed to have passed away
when a shout came over the water, and i looked, and lo, there lay
right away from the vessel, a boat that was standing by
they had seen our forms on the vessel, as the flames lit up the sky

i shouted a prayer to heaven, then called to my wife, and she
tore with new strength at my fetters--god helped her, and i was free
then over the burning bulwarks we leaped for one chance of life
did they save us? well, here i am, sir, and yonder's my dear old wife

we were out in the boat till daylight, when a great ship passing by
took us on board, and at melbourne landed us by and by
we've played many parts in dramas since we went on that famous trip
but ne'er such a scene together as we had on the burning ship



a sad-faced little fellow sits alone in deep disgrace
there's a lump arising in his throat, tears streaming down his face
he wandered from his playmates, for he doesn't want to hear
their shouts of merry laughter, since the world has lost its cheer
he has sipped the cup of sorrow, he has drained the bitter glass
and his heart is fairly breaking; he's the boy who didn't pass

in the apple tree the robin sings a cheery little song
but he doesn't seem to hear it, showing plainly something's wrong
comes his faithful little spaniel for a romp and bit of play
but the troubled little fellow sternly bids him go away
all alone he sits in sorrow, with his hair a tangled mass
and his eyes are red with weeping; he's the boy who didn't pass

how he hates himself for failing, he can hear his playmates jeer
for they've left him with the dullards--gone ahead a half a year
and he tried so hard to conquer, oh, he tried to do his best
but now he knows, he's weaker, yes, and duller than the rest
he's ashamed to tell his mother, for he thinks she'll hate him, too
the little boy who didn't pass, who failed of getting through

oh, you who boast a laughing son, and speak of him as bright
and you who love a little girl who comes to you at night
with smiling eyes, with dancing feet, with honors from her school
turn to that lonely little boy who thinks he is a fool
and take him kindly by the hand, the dullest in his class
he is the one who most needs love, the boy who didn't pass


yes, it's a quiet station, but it suits me well enough
i want a bit of the smooth now, for i've had my share o' rough
this berth that the company gave me, they gave as the work was light
i was never fit for the signals after one awful night
i'd been in the box from a younker, and i'd never felt the strain
of the lives at my right hand's mercy in every passing train
one day there was something happened, and it made my nerves go queer
and it's all through that as you find me the station-master here

i was on at the box down yonder--that's where we turn the mails
and specials, and fast expresses, on to the center rails
the side's for the other traffic--the luggage and local slows
it was rare hard work at christmas, when double the traffic grows
i've been in the box down yonder nigh sixteen hours a day
till my eyes grew dim and heavy, and my thoughts went all astray
but i've worked the points half-sleeping--and once i slept outright
till the roar of the limited woke me, and i nearly died with fright

then i thought of the lives in peril, and what might have been their fate
had i sprung to the points that evening a tenth of a tick too late
and a cold and ghastly shiver ran icily through my frame
as i fancied the public clamor, the trial, and bitter shame
i could see the bloody wreckage--i could see the mangled slain
and the picture was seared for ever, blood-red, on my heated brain
that moment my nerve was shattered, for i couldn't shut out the thought
of the lives i held in my keeping, and the ruin that might be wrought

that night in our little cottage, as i kissed our sleeping child
my wife looked up from her sewing, and told me, as she smiled
that johnny had made his mind up--he'd be a pointsman, too
i frowned, for my heart was heavy, and my wife she saw the look
lord bless you! my little alice could read me like a book
i'd to tell her of what had happened, and i said that i must leave
for a pointsman's arm ain't trusty when terror lurks in his sleeve

but she cheered me up in a minute, and that night, ere we went to sleep
she made me give her a promise, which i swore that i'd always keep
it was always to do my duty. "do that, and then, come what will
you'll have no worry." said alice, "if things go well or ill
there's something that always tells us the thing that we ought to do
my wife was a bit religious, and in with the chapel crew

now, the very next day the missus had to go to the market town
she'd the christmas things to see to, and she wanted to buy a gown
she'd be gone for a spell, for the parley didn't come back till eight
and i knew, on a christmas eve, too, the trains would be extra late
so she settled to leave me johnny, and then she could turn the key
for she'd have some parcels to carry, and the boy would be safe with me
he was five, was our little johnny, and quiet, and nice, and good
he was mad to go with daddy, and i'd often promised he should

it was noon when the missus started,--her train went by my box
she could see, as she passed my window, her darling's curly locks
i lifted him up to mammy, and he kissed his little hand
then sat, like a mouse, in the corner, and thought it was fairyland
but somehow i fell a-thinking of a scene that would not fade
of how i had slept on duty, until i grew afraid
for the thought would weigh upon me, one day i might come to lie
in a felon's cell for the slaughter of those i had doomed to die

the fit that had come upon me, like a hideous nightmare seemed
till i rubbed my eyes and started like a sleeper who has dreamed
for a time the box had vanished--i'd worked like a mere machine
my mind had been on the wander, and i'd neither heard nor seen
with a start i thought of johnny, and i turned the boy to seek
then i uttered a groan of anguish, for my lips refused to speak
there had flashed such a scene of horror swift on my startled sight
that it curdled my blood in terror and sent my red lips white

it was all in one awful moment--i saw that the boy was lost
he had gone for a toy, i fancied, some child from a train had tossed
the local was easing slowly to stop at the station here
and the limited mail was coming, and i had the line to clear
i could hear the roar of the engine, i could almost feel its breath
and right on the center metals stood my boy in the jaws of death
on came the fierce fiend, tearing straight for the center line
and the hand that must wreck or save it, o merciful god, was mine

up to god's ear that moment a wild, fierce question flew
on the wind came the words, "your duty," borne to my listening ear
then i set my teeth, and my breathing was fierce and short and quick
the hot black smoke of the engine came with a rush before
i turned the mail to the center, and by it flew with a roar

then i sank on my knees in horror, and hid my ashen face
i had given my child to heaven; his life was a hundred's grace
had i held my hand a moment, i had hurled the flying mail
to shatter the creeping local that stood on the other rail
where is my boy, my darling? o god! let me hide my eyes
how can i look--his father--on that which there mangled lies
that voice!--o merciful heaven!--'tis the child's, and he calls my name
i hear, but i cannot see him, for my eyes are filled with flame

i knew no more that night, sir, for i fell, as i heard the boy
the place reeled round, and i fainted,--swooned with the sudden joy
but i heard on the christmas morning, when i woke in my own warm bed
with alice's arms around me, and a strange wild dream in my head
that she'd come by the early local, being anxious about the lad
and had seen him there on the metals, and the sight nigh drove her mad
she had seen him just as the engine of the limited closed my view
and she leapt on the line and saved him just as the mail dashed through

she was back in the train in a second, and both were safe and sound
the moment they stopped at the station she ran here, and i was found
with my eyes like a madman's glaring, and my face a ghastly white
i heard the boy, and i fainted, and i hadn't my wits that night
who told me to do my duty? what voice was that on the wind
was it fancy that brought it to me? or were there god's lips behind
if i hadn't 'a' done my duty--had i ventured to disobey
my bonny boy and his mother might have died by my hand that day




hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings
and phoebus 'gins arise
his steeds to water at those springs
on chaliced flowers that lies
and winking mary-buds begin
to ope their golden eyes
with every thing that pretty is
my lady sweet, arise
arise, arise



in a dark and dismal alley where the sunshine never came
dwelt a little lad named tommy, sickly, delicate, and lame
he had never yet been healthy, but had lain since he was born
dragging out his weak existence well nigh hopeless and forlorn

he was six, was little tommy, 'twas just five years ago
since his drunken mother dropped him, and the babe was crippled so
he had never known the comfort of a mother's tender care
but her cruel blows and curses made his pain still worse to bear

there he lay within the cellar, from the morning till the night
starved, neglected, cursed, ill-treated, nought to make his dull life
bright
not a single friend to love him, not a loving thing to love
for he knew not of a saviour, or a heaven up above

tommy's little heart was sinking, and he felt so lonely, till
floating up the quiet alley, wafted inwards from the street
came the sound of some one singing, sounding, oh! so clear and sweet

eagerly did tommy listen as the singing came
oh! that he could see the singer! how he wished he wasn't lame
then he called and shouted loudly, till the singer heard the sound
and on noting whence it issued, soon the little cripple found

all her garments torn and ragged, her appearance far from neat
most folks call me singing jessie; wot may your name chance to be

for it makes me feel so happy--sing me something, anything
jessie laughed, and answered smiling, "i can't stay here very long
but i'll sing a hymn to please you, wot i calls the 'glory song

then she sang to him of heaven, pearly gates, and streets of gold
where the happy angel children are not starved or nipped with cold
but where happiness and gladness never can decrease or end
and where kind and loving jesus is their sovereign and their friend

oh! how tommy's eyes did glisten as he drank in every word
as it fell from "singing jessie"--was it true, what he had heard
and so anxiously he asked her, "is there really such a place
and a tear began to trickle down his pallid little face

and if yer will love the saviour, yer shall go there when yer die
when i'm down in this 'ere cellar, and he's up in heaven above

so the little ragged maiden who had heard at sunday school
all about the way to heaven, and the christian's golden rule
taught the little cripple tommy how to love, and how to pray
then she sang a "song of jesus," kissed his cheek and went away

tommy lay within the cellar which had grown so dark and cold
thinking all about the children in the streets of shining gold
and he heeded not the darkness of that damp and chilly room
for the joy in tommy's bosom could disperse the deepest gloom

so he put his hands together, and he closed his little eyes
and in accents weak, yet earnest, sent this message to the skies

that yer cared for little cripples who is weak and very poor
and i never heard of heaven till that jessie came to-day
and told me all about it, so i wants to try and pray

and i somehow must believe it, for it seems so prime and good
and she told me if i loved you, i should see yer when i die
in the bright and happy heaven that is up beyond the sky

for i heard my mother whisper, she'd be glad if i could go
and i'm cold and hungry sometimes; and i feel so lonely, too
can't yer take me, gentle jesus, up to heaven along o' you

and your kindness to me, jesus, i would surely not forget
i would love you all i know of, and would never make a noise
can't you find me just a corner, where i'll watch the other boys

for i feel so glad and happy, and i do so want to go
how i long to see yer, jesus, and the children all so bright
come and fetch me, won't yer, jesus? come and fetch me home tonight

tommy ceased his supplication, he had told his soul's desire
and he waited for the answer till his head began to tire
then he turned towards his corner and lay huddled in a heap
closed his little eyes so gently, and was quickly fast asleep

oh, i wish that every scoffer could have seen his little face
as he lay there in the corner, in that damp, and noisome place
for his countenance was shining like an angel's, fair and bright
and it seemed to fill the cellar with a holy, heavenly light

he had only heard of jesus from a ragged singing girl
he might well have wondered, pondered, till his brain began to whirl
but he took it as she told it, and believed it then and there
simply trusting in the saviour, and his kind and tender care

in the morning, when the mother came to wake her crippled boy
she discovered that his features wore a look of sweetest joy
and she shook him somewhat roughly, but the cripple's face was cold
he had gone to join the children in the streets of shining gold

tommy's prayer had soon been answered, and the angel death had come
to remove him from his cellar, to his bright and heavenly home
where sweet comfort, joy, and gladness never can decrease or end
and where jesus reigns eternally, his sovereign and his friend



it was a bright and lovely summer's morn
fair bloomed the flowers, the birds sang softly sweet
the air was redolent with perfumed balm
and nature scattered, with unsparing hand
her loveliest graces over hill and dale
an artist, weary of his narrow room
within the city's pent and heated walls
had wandered long amid the ripening fields
until, remembering his neglected themes
he thought to turn his truant steps toward home
these led him through a rustic, winding lane
lined with green hedge-rows spangled close with flowers
and overarched by trees of noblest growth
but when at last he reached the farther end
of this sweet labyrinth, he there beheld
a vision of such pure, pathetic grace
that weariness and haste were both obscured
it was a child--a young and lovely child
with eyes of heavenly hue, bright golden hair
and dimpled hands clasped in a morning prayer
kneeling beside its youthful mother's knee
upon that baby brow of spotless snow
no single trace of guilt, or pain, or woe
no line of bitter grief or dark despair
of envy, hatred, malice, worldly care
had ever yet been written. with bated breath
and hand uplifted as in warning, swift
the artist seized his pencil, and there traced
in soft and tender lines that image fair
then, when 'twas finished, wrote beneath one word
a word of holiest import--innocence

years fled and brought with them a subtle change
scattering time's snow upon the artist's brow
but leaving there the laurel wreath of fame
while all men spake in words of praise his name
for he had traced full many a noble work
upon the canvas that had touched men's souls
and drawn them from the baser things of earth
toward the light and purity of heaven
one day, in tossing o'er his folio's leaves
he chanced upon the picture of the child
which he had sketched that bright morn long before
and then forgotten. now, as he paused to gaze
a ray of inspiration seemed to dart
straight from those eyes to his. he took the sketch
placed it before his easel, and with care
that seemed but pleasure, painted a fair theme
touching and still re-touching each bright lineament
until all seemed to glow with life divine
the artist could not pause. he needs must have
a meet companion for his fairest theme
and so he sought the wretched haunts of sin
through miry courts of misery and guilt
seeking a face which at the last was found
within a prison cell there crouched a man
nay, rather say a fiend--with countenance seamed
and marred by all the horrid lines of sin
each mark of degradation might be traced
and every scene of horror he had known
and every wicked deed that he had done
were visibly written on his lineaments
even the last, worst deed of all, that left him here
a parricide within a murderer's cell

here then the artist found him; and with hand
made skillful by its oft-repeated toil
transferred unto his canvas that vile face
and also wrote beneath it just one word
a word of darkest import--it was vice
then with some inspiration not his own
thinking, perchance, to touch that guilty heart
and wake it to repentance e'er too late
the artist told the tale of that bright morn
placed the two pictured faces side by side
and brought the wretch before them. with a shriek
that echoed through those vaulted corridors
like to the cries that issue from the lips
of souls forever doomed to woe
prostrate upon the stony floor he fell
and hid his face and groaned aloud in anguish
in the gracious years forever fled
that innocent and happy little child
these very hands were raised to god in prayer
that now are reddened with a mother's blood
great heaven! can such things be? almighty power
send forth thy dart and strike me where i lie

he rose, laid hold upon the artist's arm
and grasped it with demoniac power
the while he cried: "go forth, i say, go forth
and tell my history to the tempted youth
i looked upon the wine when it was red
i heeded not my mother's piteous prayers
i heeded not the warnings of my friends
but tasted of the wine when it was red
until it left a demon in my heart
that led me onward, step by step, to this
this horrible place from which my body goes
unto the gallows, and my soul to hell
he ceased as last. the artist turned and fled
but even as he went, unto his ears
were borne the awful echoes of despair
which the lost wretch flung on the empty air
cursing the demon that had brought him there


there are two kinds of people on earth to-day
just two kinds of people, no more, i say

not the sinner and saint, for it's well understood
the good are half bad and the bad are half good

not the rich and the poor, for to rate a man's wealth
you must first know the state of his conscience and health

not the humble and proud, for in life's little span
who puts on vain airs is not counted a man

not the happy and sad, for the swift flying years
bring each man his laughter and each man his tears

no; the two kinds of people on earth i mean
are the people who lift and the people who lean

wherever you go, you will find the earth's masses
are always divided in just these two classes

and, oddly enough, you will find, too, i ween
there's only one lifter to twenty who lean

in which class are you? are you easing the load
of overtaxed lifters, who toil down the road

or are you a leaner, who lets others share
your portion of labor, and worry and care



it isn't the thing you do, dear
it's the thing you leave undone
that gives you a bit of a heartache
at the setting of the sun
the tender word forgotten
the letter you did not write
the flowers you did not send, dear
are your haunting ghosts at night

the stone you might have lifted
out of a brother's way
the bit of hearthstone counsel
you were hurried too much to say
the loving touch of the hand, dear
the gentle, winning tone
which you had no time nor thought for
with troubles enough of your own

those little acts of kindness
so easily out of mind
those chances to be angels
which we poor mortals find
they come in night and silence
each sad, reproachful wraith
when hope is faint and flagging
and a chill has fallen on faith

for life is all too short, dear
and sorrow is all too great
to suffer our slow compassion
that tarries until too late
and it isn't the thing you do, dear
it's the thing you leave undone
which gives you a bit of a heartache
at the setting of the sun



give me that grand old volume, the gift of a mother's love
tho' the spirit that first taught me has winged its flight above
yet, with no legacy but this, she has left me wealth untold
yea, mightier than earth's riches, or the wealth of ophir's gold

when a child, i've kneeled beside her, in our dear old cottage home
and listened to her reading from that prized and cherished tome
as with low and gentle cadence, and a meek and reverent mien
god's word fell from her trembling lips, like a presence felt and seen

solemn and sweet the counsels that spring from its open page
written with all the fervor and zeal of  the prophet age
full of the inspiration of the holy bards who trod
caring not for the scoffer's scorn, if they gained a soul to god

men who in mind were godlike, and have left on its blazoned scroll
food for all coming ages in its manna of the soul
who, through long days of anguish, and nights devoid of ease
still wrote with the burning pen of faith its higher mysteries

i can list that good man yonder, in the gray church by the brook
take up that marvelous tale of love, of the story and the book
how through the twilight glimmer, from the earliest dawn of time
it was handed down as an heirloom, in almost every clime

how through strong persecution and the struggle of evil days
the precious light of the truth ne'er died, but was fanned to a beacon
blaze
how in far-off lands, where the cypress bends o'er the laurel bough
it was hid like some precious treasure, and they bled for its truth, as

he tells how there stood around it a phalanx none could break
though steel and fire and lash swept on, and the cruel wave lapt the stake
how dungeon doors and prison bars had never damped the flame
but raised up converts to the creed whence christian comfort came

that housed in caves and caverns--how it stirs our scottish blood
the convenanters, sword in hand, poured forth the crimson flood
and eloquent grows the preacher, as the sabbath sunshine falls
thro' cobwebbed and checkered pane, a halo on the walls

that still 'mid sore disaster, in the heat and strife of doubt
some bear the gospel oriflamme, and one by one march out
till forth from heathen kingdoms, and isles beyond the sea
the glorious tidings of the book spread christ's salvation free

so i cling to my mother's bible, in its torn and tattered boards
as one of the greatest gems of art, and the king of all other hoards
as in life the true consoler, and in death ere the judgment call
the guide that will lead to the shining shore, where the father waits
for all


this poem was read by edwin markham at the dedication of the lincoln
memorial at washington, d.c., may 30, 1922. before reading, he said: "no
oration, no poem, can rise to the high level of this historic hour
nevertheless, i venture to inscribe this revised version of my lincoln
poem to this stupendous lincoln memorial, to this far-shining monument
of remembrance, erected in immortal marble to the honor of our deathless
martyr--the consecrated statesman, the ideal american, the ever-beloved
friend of humanity

when the norn mother saw the whirlwind hour
greatening and darkening as it hurried on
she left the heaven of heroes and came down
to make a man to meet the mortal need
she took the tried clay of the common road
clay warm yet with the genial heat of earth
dasht through it all a strain of prophecy
tempered the heap with thrill of human tears
then mixt a laughter with the serious stuff
into the shape she breathed a flame to light
that tender, tragic, ever-changing face
and laid on him a sense of the mystic powers
moving--all husht--behind the mortal veil
here was a man to hold against the world
a man to match the mountains and the sea

the color of the ground was in him, the red earth
the smack and tang of elemental things
the rectitude and patience of the cliff
the good-will of the rain that loves all leaves
the friendly welcome of the wayside well
the courage of the bird that dares the sea
the gladness of the wind that shakes the corn
the pity of the snow that hides all scars
the secrecy of streams that make their way
under the mountain to the rifted rock
the tolerance and equity of light
that gives as freely to the shrinking flower
as to the great oak flaring to the wind
to the grave's low hill as to the matterhorn
that shoulders out the sky. sprung from the west
he drank the valorous youth of a new world
the strength of virgin forests braced his mind
the hush of spacious prairies stilled his soul
his words were oaks in acorns; and his thoughts
were roots that firmly gript the granite truth

up from log cabin to the capitol
one fire was on his spirit, one resolve
to send the keen ax to the root of wrong
clearing a free way for the feet of god
the eyes of conscience testing every stroke
to make his deed the measure of a man
he built the rail-pile as he built the state
pouring his splendid strength through every blow
the grip that swung the ax in illinois
was on the pen that set a people free

so came the captain with the mighty heart
and when the judgment thunders split the house
wrenching the rafters from their ancient rest
he held the ridgepole up, and spikt again
the rafters of the home. he held his place
held the long purpose like a growing tree
held on through blame and faltered not at praise
and when he fell in whirlwind, he went down
as when a lordly cedar, green with boughs
goes down with a great shout upon the hills
and leaves a lonesome place against the sky



if i had known in the morning
how wearily all the day
the words unkind
would trouble my mind
i said when you went away
i had been more careful, darling
nor given you needless pain
but we vex "our own
with look and tone
we may never take back again

for though in the quiet evening
you may give me the kiss of peace
yet it might be
that never for me
the pain of the heart should cease
how many go forth in the morning
that never come home at night
and hearts have broken
for harsh words spoken
that sorrow can ne'er set right

we have careful thoughts for the stranger
and smiles for the sometime guest
but oft for "our own
the bitter tone
though we love "our own" the best
ah, lips with the curve impatient
ah, brow with that look of scorn
were the night too late
to undo the work of morn



the gate was thrown open, i rode out alone
more proud than a monarch, who sits on a throne
i am but a jockey, but shout upon shout
went up from the people who watched me ride out
and the cheers that rang forth from that warm-hearted crowd
were as earnest as those to which monarch e'er bowed
my heart thrilled with pleasure so keen it was pain
as i patted my salvator's soft, silken mane
and a sweet shiver shot from his hide to my hand
as we passed by the multitude down to the stand
the great wave of cheering came billowing back
as the hoofs of brave tenny ran swift down the track
and he stood there beside us, all bone and all muscle
our noble opponent, well trained for the tussle
that waited us there on the smooth, shining course
my salvator, fair to the lovers of horse
as a beautiful woman is fair to man's sight
pure type of the thoroughbred, clean-limbed and bright
stood taking the plaudits as only his due
and nothing at all unexpected or new

and then there before us as the bright flag is spread
there's a roar from the grand stand, and tenny's ahead
at the sound of the voices that shouted, "a go
he sprang like an arrow shot straight from the bow
i tighten the reins on prince charlie's great son
he is off like a rocket, the race is begun
half-way down the furlong their heads are together
scarce room 'twixt their noses to wedge in a feather
past grand stand, and judges, in neck-to-neck strife
ah, salvator, boy, 'tis the race of your life
i press my knees closer, i coax him, i urge
i feel him go out with a leap and a surge
i see him creep on, inch by inch, stride by stride
while backward, still backward, falls tenny beside
we are nearing the turn, the first quarter is passed
the distance elongates; still tenny sweeps on
as graceful and free-limbed and swift as a fawn
his awkwardness vanished, his muscles all strained
a noble opponent well born and well trained

i glanced o'er my shoulder; ha! tenny! the cost
of that one second's flagging will be--the race lost
one second's yielding of courage and strength
and the daylight between us has doubled its length
the first mile is covered, the race is mine--no
for the blue blood of tenny responds to a blow
he shoots through the air like a ball from a gun
and the two lengths between us are shortened to one
my heart is contracted, my throat feels a lump
for tenny's long neck is at salvator's rump
and now with new courage grown bolder and bolder
i see him once more running shoulder to shoulder
with knees, hands and body i press my grand steed
i urge him, i coax him, i pray him to heed
o salvator! salvator! list to my calls
for the blow of my whip will hurt both if it falls
there's a roar from the crowd like the ocean in storm
as close to the saddle leaps tenny's great form
one mighty plunge, and with knee, limb and hand
i lift my horse first by a nose past the stand
we are under the string now--the great race is done
and salvator, salvator, salvator won

cheer, hoary-headed patriarchs; cheer loud, i say
though ye live twice the space that's allotted to men
ye never will see such a grand race again
let the shouts of the populace roar like the surf
for salvator, salvator, king of the turf
he has rivaled the record of thirteen long years
he has won the first place in the vast line of peers
and even his enemies grant him his place
down into the dust let old records be hurled
and hang out 2:05 to the gaze of the world



i'd like to hunt the injuns 't roam the boundless plain
i'd like to be a pirate an' plow the ragin' main
an' capture some big island, in lordly pomp to rule
but i just can't be nothin' cause i got to go to school

the least amount o' learnin' by a flickerin' pitch pine knot
an' many a darin' boy like me grows up to be a fool
an' never 'mounts to nothin' 'cause he's got to go to school

i'd like to be a cowboy an' rope the texas steer
i'd like to be a sleuth-houn' or a bloody buccaneer
an' leave the foe to welter where their blood had made a pool
but how can i git famous? 'cause i got to go to school

i don't see how my parents kin make the big mistake
o' keepin' down a boy like me 'at's got a name to make
it ain't no wonder boys is bad, an' balky as a mule
life ain't worth livin' if you've got to waste your time in school

i'd like to be regarded as "the terror of the plains
i'd like to hear my victims shriek an' clank their prison chains
i'd like to face the enemy with gaze serene an' cool
an' wipe 'em off the earth, but pshaw! i got to go to school

what good is 'rithmetic an' things, exceptin' jest for girls
er them there fauntleroys 'at wears their hair in pretty curls
an' if my name is never seen on hist'ry's page, why, you'll
remember 'at it's all because i got to go to school




silent he watched them--the soldiers and dog
tin toys on the little armchair
keeping their tryst through the slow going years
for the hand that had stationed them there
and he said that perchance the dust and the rust
hid the griefs that the toy friends knew
and his heart watched with them all the dark years
yearning ever for little boy blue

three mourners they were for little boy blue
three ere the cold winds had begun
now two are left watching--the soldier and dog
but for him the vigil is done
for him too, the angel has chanted a song
a song that is lulling and true
he has seen the white gates of the mansions of rest
thrown wide by his little boy blue

god sent not the angel of death for his soul
not the reaper who cometh for all
but out of the shadows that curtained the day
he heard his lost little one call
heard the voice that he loved, and following fast
passed on to the far-away strand
and he walks the streets of the city of peace
with little boy blue by the hand



in gettysburg at break of day
the hosts of war are held in leash
to gird them for the coming fray
e'er brazen-throated monsters flame
mad hounds of death that tear and maim
ho, boys in blue
and gray so true
fate calls to-day the roll of fame

on cemetery hill was done
the clangor of four hundred guns
through drifting smoke the morning sun
shone down a line of battled gray
where pickett's waiting soldiers lay
virginians all
heed glory's call
you die at gettysburg to-day

great lee had named; he knew them well
oft had their steel the battle stayed
o warriors of the eagle plume
fate points for you the hour of doom
ring rebel yell
war cry and knell
the stars, to-night, will set in gloom

o pickett's men, ye sons of fate
awe-stricken nations bide your deeds
for you the centuries did wait
while wrong had writ her lengthening scroll
and god had set the judgment roll
a thousand years
shall wait in tears
and one swift hour bring to goal

the charge is done, a cause is lost
but pickett's men heed not the din
of ragged columns battle tost
for fame enshrouds them on the field
and pierced, virginia, is thy shield
but stars and bars
shall drape thy scars
no cause is lost till honor yield


w'en you see a man in woe
walk right up and say "hullo
say "hullo" and "how d'ye do
how's the world a-usin' you
slap the fellow on the back
bring your hand down with a whack
walk right up, and don't go slow
grin an' shake, an' say "hullo

is he clothed in rags? oh! sho
walk right up an' say "hullo
rags is but a cotton roll
jest for wrappin' up a soul
an' a soul is worth a true
hale and hearty "how d'ye do
don't wait for the crowd to go
walk right up and say "hullo

when big vessels meet, they say
they saloot an' sail away
jest the same are you an' me
lonesome ships upon a sea
each one sailin' his own log
for a port behind the fog
let your speakin' trumpet blow
lift your horn an' cry "hullo

say "hullo!" an' "how d'ye do
other folks are good as you
w'en you leave your house of clay
wanderin' in the far away
w'en you travel through the strange
country t'other side the range
then the souls you've cheered will know
who ye be, an' say "hullo



bring, novelist, your note-book! bring, dramatist, your pen
and i'll tell you a simple story of what women do for men
it's only a tale of a lifeboat, of the dying and the dead
of the terrible storm and shipwreck that happened off mumbles head
maybe you have traveled in wales, sir, and know it north and south
maybe you are friends with the "natives" that dwell at oystermouth
it happens, no doubt, that from bristol you've crossed in a casual way
and have sailed your yacht in the summer in the blue of swansea bay

well! it isn't like that in the winter, when the lighthouse stands alone
in the teeth of atlantic breakers that foam on its face of stone
it wasn't like that when the hurricane blew, and the storm-bell tolled
or when
there was news of a wreck, and the lifeboat launched, and a desperate cry
for men
when in the world did the coxswain shirk? a brave old salt was he
proud to the bone of as four strong lads as ever had tasted the sea
welshmen all to the lungs and loins, who, about that coast, 'twas said
had saved some hundred lives apiece--at a shilling or so a head

so the father launched the lifeboat, in the teeth of the tempest's roar
and he stood like a man at the rudder, with an eye on his boys at the oar
out to the wreck went the father! out to the wreck went the sons
leaving the weeping of women, and booming of signal guns
leaving the mother who loved them, and the girls that the sailors love
going to death for duty, and trusting to god above
do you murmur a prayer, my brothers, when cozy and safe in bed
for men like these, who are ready to die for a wreck off mumbles head
it didn't go well with the lifeboat! 'twas a terrible storm that blew
and it snapped the' rope in a second that was flung to the drowning crew

and then the anchor parted--'twas a tussle to keep afloat
but the father stuck to the rudder, and the boys to the brave old boat
then at last on the poor doomed lifeboat a wave broke mountains high
half of the crew swam shoreward, half to the sheltered caves
but father and sons were fighting death in the foam of the angry waves

up at a lighthouse window two women beheld the storm
and saw in the boiling breakers a figure--a fighting form
it might be a gray-haired father, then the women held their breath
it might be a fair-haired brother, who was having a round with death
it might be a lover, a husband, whose kisses were on the lips
of the women whose love is the life of men going down to the sea in ships
they had seen the launch of the lifeboat, they had seen the worst, and
then, kissing each other, these women went down from the lighthouse
straight to shore

there by the rocks on the breakers these sisters, hand in hand
beheld once more that desperate man who struggled to reach the land
but what are a couple of women with only a man to save
what are a couple of women? well, more than three craven men
who stood by the shore with chattering teeth, refusing to stir--and then
off went the women's shawls, sir; in a second they're torn and rent
then knotting them into a rope of love, straight into the sea they went

as they caught the waves on their foreheads, resisting the fierce attack

we'll lose our lives, god willing, before that man shall drown

just follow me, brave, to the shingle, and we'll bring him safe to land
wait for the next wave, darling! only a minute more
and i'll have him safe in my arms, dear, and we'll drag him to the shore
up to the arms in the water, fighting it breast to breast
they caught and saved a brother alive. god bless them! you know the rest
well, many a heart beat stronger, and many a tear was shed
and many a glass was tossed right off to "the women of mumbles head



that man on the enjine thar
don't pack the han'somest countenance
every inch of it sportin' a scar
but i tell you, pard, thar ain't money enough
piled up in the national banks
to buy that face, nor a single scar

an' a better one never war knowed
bin a runnin' yar since the fust machine
war put on the quincy road
an' thar ain't a galoot that pulls a plug
from maine to the jumpin' off place
that knows more about the big iron hoss
than him with the battered-up face

in a sort o' legitimate way
he got it a-trying to save a gal
up yar on the road last may
i heven't much time for to spin you the yarn
for we pull out at two-twenty-five
just wait till i climb up an' toss in some coal
so's to keep old '90' alive

left quincy a half an hour late
an' war skimmin' along purty lively, so's not
to lay out no. 21 freight
the '90' war more than whoopin' 'em up
an' a-quiverin' in every nerve
when all to once jim yelled 'merciful god
as she shoved her sharp nose 'round a curve

stood a gal on the track, her hands raised aloft
an' her face jist as white as the snow
it seems she war so paralyzed with the fright
that she couldn't move for'ard or back
an' when jim pulled the whistle she fainted an' fell
right down in a heap on the track

the look that cum over jim's face
he throw'd the old lever cl'r back like a shot
so's to slacken the '90's' wild pace
then let on the air brakes as quick as a flash
an' out through the window he fled
an' skinned 'long the runnin' board cla'r in front
an' lay on the pilot ahead

he grabbed a tight hold, of her arm
an' raised her right up so's to throw her one side
out o' reach of danger an' harm
but somehow he slipped an' fell with his head
on the rail as he throw'd the young lass
an' the pilot in strikin' him, ground up his face
in a frightful and horrible mass

to that spot where the poor fellow lay
an' there sot the gal with his head in her lap
an' wipin' the warm blood away
the tears rolled in torrents right down from her eyes
while she sobbed like her heart war all broke
i tell you, my friend, such a sight as that 'ar
would move the tough heart of an oak

what for week arter week the boy lay
a-hoverin' right in the shadder o' death
an' that gal by his bed every day
but nursin' an' doctorin' brought him around
kinder snatched him right outer the grave
his face ain't so han'some as 'twar, but his heart
remains just as noble an' brave

he fell dead in love, did this jim
but hadn't the heart to ax her to have
sich a batter'd-up rooster as him
she know'd how he felt, and last new year's day
war the fust o' leap year as you know
so she jist cornered jim an' proposed on the spot
an' you bet he didn't say no

an' has laid up a snug pile o' cash
the weddin's to be on the first o' next may
jist a year from the day o' the smash
the gal says he risked his dear life to save hers
an' she'll just turn the tables about
an' give him the life that he saved--thar's the bell
good day, sir, we're goin' to pull out


sometimes w'en i am playin' with some fellers 'at i knows
my ma she comes to call me, 'cause she wants me, i surpose
an' then she calls in this way: "willie! willie, dear! willee-e-ee
an' you'd be surprised to notice how dretful deef i be
an' the fellers 'at are playin' they keeps mos' orful still
w'ile they tell me, jus' in whispers: "your ma is callin', bill
but my hearin' don't git better, so fur as i can see
w'ile my ma stan's there a-callin': "willie! willie, dear! willee-e-ee

an' soon my ma she gives it up, an' says: "well, i'll allow
it's mighty cur'us w'ere that boy has got to, anyhow
an' then i keep on playin' jus' the way i did before
i know if she was wantin' much she'd call to me some more
an' purty soon she comes agin an' says: "willie! willee-e-ee
but my hearin's jus' as hard as w'at it useter be
if a feller has good judgment, an' uses it that way
he can almos' allers manage to git consid'ble play

but jus' w'ile i am playin', an' prob'ly i am "it
they's somethin' diff'rent happens, an' i have to up, an' git
fer my pa comes to the doorway, an' he interrup's our glee
he jus' says, "william henry!" but that's enough fer me
you'd be surprised to notice how quickly i can hear
w'en my pa says, "william henry!" but never "willie, dear
fer though my hearin's middlin' bad to hear the voice of ma
it's apt to show improvement w'en the callin' comes from pa


dear little flag in the window there
hung with a tear and a woman's prayer
child of old glory, born with a star
oh, what a wonderful flag you are

blue is your star in its field of white
dipped in the red that was born of fight
born of the blood that our forebears shed
to raise your mother, the flag, o'er-head

and now you've come, in this frenzied day
to speak from a window--to speak and say
gone, to be gone till the victory's won

the flag of his mother--i speak for her
who stands by my window and waits and fears
but hides from the others her unwept tears

for the safe return of a martial mate
a mate gone forth where the war god thrives
to save from sacrifice other men's wives

the often unthought of--the sisters, too
i am the flag of a mother's son
who won't come home till the victory's won

dear little flag in the window there
hung with a tear and a woman's prayer
child of old glory, born with a star
oh, what a wonderful flag you are




cheeriest room, that morn, the kitchen. helped by bridget's willing hands
bustled hannah, deftly mixing pies, for ready waiting pans
little flossie flitted round them, and her curling, floating hair
glinted gold-like, gleamed and glistened, in the sparkling sunlit air
slouched a figure o'er the lawn; a man so wretched and forlore
tattered, grim, so like a beggar, ne'er had trod that path before
his shirt was torn, his hat was gone, bare and begrimed his knees
face with blood and dirt disfigured, elbows peeped from out his sleeves
rat-tat-tat, upon the entrance, brought aunt hannah to the door
parched lips humbly plead for water, as she scanned his misery o'er
wrathful came the dame's quick answer; made him cower, shame, and start
out of sight, despairing, saddened, hurt and angry to the heart
move, you thief! leave now these grounds, sir, or our dogs will help you
quick
then the man with dragging footsteps hopeless, wishing himself dead
crept away from sight of plenty, starved in place of being fed
wandered farther from the mansion, till he reached a purling brook
babbling, trilling broken music by a green and shady nook
here sweet flossie found him fainting; in her hands were food and drink
pale like death lay he before her, yet the child-heart did not shrink
then the rags from off his forehead, she with dainty hands offstripped
in the brooklet's rippling waters, her own lace-trimmed 'kerchief dipped
then with sweet and holy pity, which, within her, did not daunt
bathed the blood and grime-stained visage of that sin-soiled son of want
wrung she then the linen cleanly, bandaged up the wound again
ere the still eyes opened slowly; white lips murmuring, "am i sane
paused he mute and undecided, while deep sobs his form did shake
with an avalanche of feeling, and great tears came rolling down
o'er a face unused to showing aught except a sullen frown
that "our god" unsealed a fountain his whole life had never known
when that human angel near him spoke of her god as his own
it may help you to forgive her: 'love your enemies and those
who despitefully may use you; love them whether friends or foes

then she glided from his vision, left him prostrate on the ground
conning o'er and o'er that lesson--with a grace to him new found
sunlight filtering through green branches as they wind-wave dance and dip
finds a prayer his mother taught him, trembling on his crime-stained lip
hist! a step, an angry mutter, and the owner of the place
gentle flossie's haughty father, and the tramp stood face to face
off with it, and cast it down here. come! be quick about it now
as the man did not obey him, flossie's father lashed his cheek
with a riding-whip he carried; struck him hard and cut him deep
quick the tramp bore down upon him, felled him, o'er him where he lay
raised a knife to seek his life-blood. then there came a thought to stay
all his angry, murderous impulse, caused the knife to shuddering fall
at midnight, lambent, lurid flames light up the sky with fiercest beams
wild cries, "fire! fire!" ring through the air, and red like blood each
flame now seems
they faster grow, they higher throw weird, direful arms which ever lean
about the gray stone mansion old. now roars the wind to aid the scene
the flames yet higher, wilder play. a shudder runs through all around
distinctly as in light of day, at topmost window from the ground
sweet flossie stands, her golden hair enhaloed now by firelit air
loud rang the father's cry: "o god! my child! my child! will no one dare
for her sweet sake the flaming stair?" look, one steps forth with muffled
leaps through the flames with fleetest feet, on trembling ladder runs a
with life and death--the window gains. deep silence falls on all around
till bursts aloud a sobbing wail. the ladder falls with crashing sound
a flaming, treacherous mass. o god! she was so young and he so brave
look once again. see! see! on highest roof he stands--the fiery wave
fierce rolling round--his arms enclasp the child--god help him yet to save
he cries, then makes a vaulting leap
a tree branch catches, with sure aim
and by the act proclaims his name
the air was rent, the cheers rang loud
a rough voice cried from out the crowd
none dares that leap but flying jim
a jail-bird--outlaw--thief, indeed
yet o'er them all takes kingly lead
i've breathed the flames, 'twill not be long
then hushed all murmurs through the throng
with reverent hands they bore him where
the summer evening's cooling air
came softly sighing through the trees
the child's proud father on his knees
forgiveness sought of god and jim
which dying lips accorded him
a mark of whip on white face stirred
to gleaming scarlet at his words
she taught me that and i fulfill
i would her hand might touch my face
though she's so pure and i so base
low flossie bent and kissed the brow
with smile of bliss transfigured now
death, the angel, sealed it there



in a pioneer's cabin out west, so they say
a great big black grizzly trotted one day
and seated himself on the hearths and began
to lap the contents of a two gallon pan
of milk and potatoes,--an excellent meal
and then looked, about to see what he could steal
the lord of the mansion awoke from his sleep
and, hearing a racket, he ventured to peep
just out in the kitchen, to see what was there
and was scared to behold a great grizzly bear

so he screamed in alarm to his slumbering frau
so betty leaped up, and the poker she seized
while her man shut the door, and against it he squeezed
as betty then laid on the grizzly her blows
now on his forehead, and now on his nose
her man through the key-hole kept shouting within
now poke with the poker, and' poke his eyes out
so, with rapping and poking, poor betty alone
at last laid sir bruin as dead as a stone

now when the old man saw the bear was no more
he ventured to poke his nose out of the door
and there was the grizzly stretched on the floor
then off to the neighbors he hastened, to tell
all the wonderful things that that morning befell
and he published the marvellous story afar
how "me and my betty jist slaughtered a bar
o yes, come and see, all the neighbors they seed it
come and see what we did, me and betty, we did it


they grew in beauty, side by side
they filled one home with glee
their graves are severed, far and wide
by mount, and stream and sea

the same fond mother bent at night
o'er each fair sleeping brow
she had each folded flower in sight
where are those dreamers now

one, 'midst the forest of the west
by a dark stream is laid
the indian knows his place of rest
far in the cedar shade

the sea, the blue lone sea, hath one
he lies where pearls lie deep
o'er his low bed may weep

one sleeps where southern vines are drest
above the noble slain
he wrapped his colors round his breast
on a blood-red field of spain

and one--o'er _her_ the myrtle showers
its leaves, by soft winds fanned
she faded 'midst italian flowers
the last of that bright band

and parted thus they rest, who play'd
beneath the same green tree
whose voices mingled as they pray'd
around the parent knee

they that with smiles lit up the hall
and cheer'd with song the hearth
alas! for love, if _thou_ wert all
and naught beyond, o earth



nae shoon to hide her tiny taes
nae stockings on her feet
her supple ankles white as snow
or early blossoms sweet
her simple dress of sprinkled pink
her double, dimpled chin
her pucker'd lip and bonny mou
with nae ane tooth between
her een sae like her mither's een
twa gentle, liquid things
her face is like an angel's face
we're glad she has nae wings



away, away in the northland
where the hours of the day are few
and the nights are so long in winter
they cannot sleep them through

where they harness the swift reindeer
to the sledges, when it snows
and the children look like bears' cubs
in their funny, furry clothes

they tell them a curious story
i don't believe 't is true
and yet you may learn a lesson
if i tell the tale to you

once, when the good saint peter
lived in the world below
and walked about it, preaching
just as he did, you know

he came to the door of a cottage
in traveling round the earth
where a little woman was making cakes
and baking them on the hearth

and being faint with fasting
for the day was almost done
he asked her, from her store of cakes
to give him a single one

so she made a very little cake
but as it baking lay
she looked at it, and thought it seemed
too large to give away

therefore she kneaded another
and still a smaller one
but it looked, when she turned it over
as large as the first had done

then she took a tiny scrap of dough
and rolled, and rolled it flat
and baked it thin as a wafer
but she couldn't part with that

for she said, "my cakes that seem too small
when i eat of them myself
are yet too large to give away
so she put them on the shelf

then good saint peter grew angry
for he was hungry and faint
and surely such a woman
was enough to provoke a saint

and he said, "you are far too selfish
to dwell in a human form
to have both food and shelter
and fire to keep you warm

and shall get your scanty food
by boring, and boring, and boring
all day in the hard dry wood

then up she went through the chimney
never speaking a word
and out of the top flew a woodpecker
for she was changed to a bird

she had a scarlet cap on her head
and that was left the same
bat all the rest of her clothes were burned
black as a coal in the flame

and every country school boy
has seen her in the wood
where she lives in the woods till this very day
boring and boring for food

and this is the lesson she teaches
live not for yourself alone
lest the needs you will not pity
shall one day be your own

give plenty of what is given to you
listen to pity's call
don't think the little you give is great
and the much you get is small

now, my little boy, remember that
and try to be kind and good
when you see the woodpecker's sooty dress
and see her scarlet hood

you mayn't be changed to a bird, though you live
as selfishly as you can
but you will be changed to a smaller thing
a mean and selfish man



did you tackle the trouble that came your way
with a resolute heart and cheerful
or hide year face from the light of day
with a craven soul and fearful
oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce
or a trouble is what you make it
and it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts
but only how did you take it

you are beaten to earth? well, well, what's that
come up with a smiling face
its nothing against you to fall down flat
but to lie there--that's disgrace
the harder you're thrown, why, the higher the bounce
be proud of your blackened eye
it isn't the fact that you're licked that counts
it's how did you fight--and why

and though you be done to the death, what then
if you battled the best you could
if you played your part in the world of men
why, the critic will call it good
death comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce
and whether he's slow or spry
it isn't the fact that you're dead that counts
but only how did you die



when the lessons and tasks are all ended
and the school for the day is dismissed
and the little ones gather around me
to bid me good-night and be kissed
oh, the little white arms that encircle
my neck in a tender embrace
oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven
shedding sunshine and love on my face

and when they, are gone, i sit dreaming
of my childhood, too lovely to last
of love that my heart will remember
when it wakes to the pulse of the past
ere the world and its wickedness made me
a partner of sorrow and sin
when the glory of god was about me
and the glory of gladness within

oh, my heart grows as weak as a woman's
and the fountains of feeling will flow
when i think of the paths, steep and stony
where the feet of the dear ones must go
of the mountains of sin hanging o'er them
of the tempests of fate blowing wild
oh, there's nothing on earth half so holy
as the innocent heart of a child

they are idols of hearts and of households
they are angels of god in disguise
his sunlight still sleeps in their tresses
his glory still beams in their eyes
oh, those truants from earth and from heaven
they have made me more manly and mild
and i know how jesus could liken
the kingdom of god to a child

seek not a life for the dear ones
all radiant, as others have done
but that life may have just enough shadow
to temper the glare of the sun
i would pray god to guard them from evil
but my prayer would bound back to myself
ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner
but the sinner must pray for himself

the twig is so easily bended
i have banished the rule of the rod
i have taught them the goodness of knowledge
they have taught me the goodness of god
my heart is a dungeon of darkness
where i shut them from breaking a rule
my frown is sufficient correction
my love is the law of the school

i shall leave the old house in the autumn
to traverse the threshold no more
ah! how i shall sigh for the dear ones
that meet me each morn at the door
i shall miss the good-nights and the kisses
and the gush of their innocent glee
the group on the green and the flowers
that are brought every morning to me

i shall miss them at morn and at evening
their song in the school and the street
i shall miss the low hum of their voices
and the tramp of their delicate feet
when the lessons and tasks are all ended
and death says the school is dismissed
may the little ones gather around me
to bid me good-night and be kissed



the sunlight shone on walls of stone
and towers sublime and tall
king alfred sat upon his throne
within his council hall

and glancing o'er the splendid throng
with grave and solemn face
to where his noble vassals stood
he saw a vacant place

with anxious look, he said

before the monarch could express
the sorrow that he felt
a soldier, with a war-worn face
approached the throne, and knelt

o king, at thy command
and many a proud and haughty dane
has fallen by my hand

and 'neath the greenwood tree
it is but fair for thee to give
yon vacant place to me

my wisdom has done more for thee
than either sword or spear

have made thee more renown
than all the triumphs of the field
have given to thy crown

my talents have been thine
bestow this earldom, then, on me
for it is justly mine

yet, while before the monarch's throne
these men contending stood
a woman crossed the floor, who wore
the weeds of widowhood

and slowly to king alfred's feet
a fair-haired boy she led
of holderness," she said

let no man do him wrong
for he is weak and fatherless
and thou art just and strong

can such a feeble child as this
do aught for thee, o king

to draw thy deadly bows
when thou art wanting crafty men
to crush thy mortal foes

with earnest voice the fair young boy
replied: "i cannot fight
but i can pray to god, o king
and god can give thee might

the king bent down and kissed the child
the courtiers turned away

our blood may stain the sod
but what are human strength and power
without the help of god



try, try again
if at first you don't succeed
try, try again
then your courage shall appear
for if you will persevere
you will conquer, never fear
try, try again

once or twice though you should fail
try, try again
if at last you would prevail
try, try again
if we strive 'tis no disgrace
tho' we may not win the race
what should you do in that case
try, try again

if you find your task is hard
try, try again
time will bring you your reward
try, try again
all that other folks can do
why, with patience, may not you
only keep this rule in view
try, try again


ye say they all have passed away--that noble race and brave
that their light canoes have vanished from off the crested wave
that,'mid the forests where they roamed, there rings no hunter's shout
but their name is on your waters--ye may not wash it out

where strong niagara's thunders wake the echo of the world
where red missouri bringeth rich tribute from the west
and rappahannock sweetly sleeps on green virginia's breast

ye say their cone-like cabins, that clustered o'er the vale
have fled away like withered leaves, before the autumn's gale
but their memory liveth on your hills, their baptism on your shore
your everlasting rivers speak their dialect of yore

old massachusetts wears it upon her lordly crown
and broad ohio bears it amid his young renown
connecticut hath wreathed it where her quiet foliage waves
and bold kentucky breathes it hoarse through all her ancient caves

wachusett hides its lingering voice within his rocky heart
and alleghany graves its tone throughout his lofty chart
monadnock on his forehead hoar doth seal the sacred trust
your mountains build their monument, though ye destroy their dust

ye call those red-browed brethren the insects of an hour
crushed like the noteless worm amid the regions of their power
ye drive them from their fathers' lands, ye break of faith the seal
but can ye from the court of heaven exclude their last appeal

ye see their unresisting tribes, with toilsome steps and slow
on through the trackless desert pass, a caravan of woe
think ye the eternal ear is deaf? his sleepless vision dim
think ye the soul's blood may not cry from that far land to him



sick in the hospital. he confided to a friend, colonel hawkins of
tennessee, that he was grieving because his fiancee, a nashville girl
had not written to him. the soldier died soon afterward, colonel hawkins
having promised to open and answer any mail that came for him. this poem
is in reply to a letter from his friend's fiancee, in which she curtly
broke the engagement

your letter, lady, came too late
for heaven had claimed its own
ah, sudden change--from prison bars
unto the great white throne
and yet i think he would have stayed
to live for his disdain
could he have read the careless words
which you have sent in vain

so full of patience did he wait
through many a weary hour
that o'er his simple soldier-faith
not even death had power
and you--did others whisper low
their homage in your ear
as though among their shallow throng
his spirit had a peer

i would that you were by me now
to draw the sheet aside
and see how pure the look he wore
the moment when he died
the sorrow that you gave to him
had left its weary trace
as 'twere the shadow of the cross
upon his pallid face

the winter's cold to spring
ah, trust of fickle maiden's love
thou art a bitter thing
for when these valleys, bright in may
once more with blossoms wave
the northern violets shall blow
above his humble grave

your dole of scanty words had been
but one more pang to bear
for him who kissed unto the last
your tress of golden hair
i did not put it where he said
for when the angels come
i would not have them find the sign
of falsehood in the tomb

i've read your letter, and i know
the wiles that you have wrought
to win that trusting heart of his
and gained it--cruel thought
what lavish wealth men sometimes give
for what is worthless all
what manly bosoms beat for them
in folly's falsest thrall

you shall not pity him, for now
his sorrow has an end
yet would that you could stand with me
beside my fallen friend
and i forgive you for his sake
as he--if he be forgiven
may e'en be pleading grace for you
before the court of heaven

to-night the cold winds whistle by
as i my vigil keep
within the prison dead-house, where
few mourners come to weep
a rude plank coffin holds his form
yet death exalts his face
and i would rather see him thus
than clasped in your embrace

to-night your home may shine with light
and ring with merry song
and you be smiling as your soul
had done no deadly wrong
your hand so fair that none would think
it penned these words of pain
your skin so white--would god your heart
were half as free from stain

i'd rather be my comrade dead
than you in life supreme
for yours the sinner's waking dread
and his the martyr's dream
whom serve we in this life we serve
in that which is to come
he chose his way, you--yours; let god
pronounce the fitting doom



a harbor in a sunny, southern city
ships at their anchor, riding in the lee
a little lad, with steadfast eyes, and dreamy
who ever watched the waters lovingly

a group of sailors, quaintly garbed and bearded
strange tales, that snared the fancy of the child
of far-off lands, strange beasts, and birds, and people
of storm and sea-fight, danger-filled and wild

and ever in the boyish soul was ringing
the urging, surging challenge of the sea
to dare,--as these men dared, its wrath and danger
to learn,--as they, its charm and mystery

columbus, by the sunny, southern harbor
you dreamed the dreams that manhood years made true
thank god for men--their deeds have crowned the ages
who once were little dreamy lads like you



i'm not a chicken; i have seen
full many a chill september
and though i was a youngster then
that gale i well remember
the day before, my kite-string snapped
and i, my kite pursuing
the wind whisked off my palm-leaf hat
for me two storms were brewing

it came as quarrels sometimes do
when married folks get clashing
there was a heavy sigh or two
before the fire was flashing
a little stir among the clouds
before they rent asunder
a little rocking of the trees
and then came on the thunder

lord! how the ponds and rivers boiled
and how the shingles rattled
and oaks were scattered on the ground
as if the titans battled
and all above was in a howl
and all below a clatter
the earth was like a frying-pan
or some such hissing matter

it chanced to be our washing-day
and all our things were drying
the storm came roaring through the lines
and set them all a-flying
i saw the shirts and petticoats
go riding off like witches
i lost, ah! bitterly i wept
i lost my sunday breeches

i saw them straddling through the air
alas! too late to win them
i saw them chase the clouds, as if
the devil had been in them
they were my darlings and my pride
my boyhood's only riches

that night i saw them in my dreams
how changed from what i knew them
the dews had steeped their faded threads
the winds had whistled through them
i saw the wide and ghastly rents
where demon claws had torn them
a hole was in their amplest part
as if an imp had worn them

i have had many happy years
and tailors kind and clever
but those young pantaloons have gone
forever and forever
and not till fate has cut the last
of all my earthly stitches
this aching heart shall cease to mourn
my loved, my long-lost breeches



somewhere, out on the blue sea sailing
where the winds dance and spin
beyond the reach of my eager hailing
over the breakers' din
out where the dark storm-clouds are lifting
out where the blinding fog is drifting
out where the treacherous sand is shifting
my ship is coming in

o, i have watched till my eyes were aching
day after weary day
o, i have hoped till my heart was breaking
while the long nights ebbed away
could i but know where the waves had tossed her
could i but know what storms had crossed her
could i but know where the winds had lost her
out in the twilight gray

but though the storms her course have altered
surely the port she'll win
never my faith in my ship has faltered
i know she is coming in
for through the restless ways of her roaming
through the mad rush of the wild waves foaming
through the white crest of the billows combing
my ship is coming in

beating the tides where the gulls are flying
swiftly she's coming in
shallows and deeps and rocks defying
bravely she's coming in
precious the love she will bring to bless me
snowy the arms she will bring to caress me
in the proud purple of kings she will dress me
my ship that is coming in

white in the sunshine her sails will be gleaming
see, where my ship comes in
at masthead and peak her colors streaming
proudly she's sailing in
love, hope and joy on her decks are cheering
music will welcome her glad appearing
and my heart will sing at her stately nearing
when my ship comes in



laugh, and the world laughs with you
weep, and you weep alone
for the sad old earth must borrow its mirth
but has trouble enough of its own

sing, and the hills will answer
sigh, it is lost on the air
the echoes bound to a joyful sound
but shirk from voicing care

rejoice and men will seek you
grieve, and they turn and go
they want full measure of all your pleasure
but they do not need your woe

be glad, and your friends are many
be sad, and you lose them all
there are none to decline your nectar'd wine
but alone you must drink life's gall

feast, and your halls are crowded
fast, and the world goes by
succeed and give, and it helps you live
but no man can help you die

there is room in the halls of pleasure
for a large and lordly train
but one by one we must all file on
through the narrow aisle of pain



the coppenter man said a wicked word
when he hitted his thumb one day
en i know what it was, because i heard
en it's somethin' i dassent say

he growed us a house with rooms inside it
en the rooms is full of floors
it's my papa's house, en when he buyed it
it was nothin' but just outdoors

en they planted stones in a hole for seeds
en that's how the house began
but i guess the stones would have just growed weeds
except for the coppenter man

en the coppenter man took a board and said
he'd skin it and make some curls
en i hung 'em onto my ears en head
en they make me look like girls

en he squinted along one side, he did
en he squinted the other side twice
en then he told me, "you squint it, kid

but the coppenter man said a wicked word
when he hitted 'his thumb that day
he said it out loud, too, 'cause i heard
en it's something i dassent say

en the coppenter man said it wasn't bad
when you hitted your thumb, kerspat
en there'd be no coppenter men to be had
if it wasn't for words like that



no, i never, till life and its shadows shall end
can forget the sweet sound of the bells of ostend
the day set in darkness, the wind it blew loud
and rung as it passed through each murmuring shroud
my forehead was wet with the foam of the spray
my heart sighed in secret for those far away
when slowly the morning advanced from the east
the toil and the noise of the tempest had ceased
the peal from a land i ne'er saw, seemed to say
yet the short-lived emotion was mingled with pain
i thought of those eyes i should ne'er see again
i thought of the kiss, the last kiss which i gave
and a tear of regret fell unseen on the wave
i thought of the schemes fond affection had planned
of the trees, of the towers, of my own native land
but still the sweet sounds, as they swelled to the air
seemed tidings of pleasure, though mournful to bear
and i never, till life and its shadows shall end
can forget the sweet sound of the bells of ostend



with sable-draped banners and slow measured tread
the flower laden ranks pass the gates of the dead
and seeking each mound where a comrade's form rests
leave tear-bedewed garlands to bloom, on his breast
ended at last is the labor of love
once more through the gateway the saddened lines move
a wailing of anguish, a sobbing of grief
falls low on the ear of the battle-scarred chief
close crouched by the portals, a sunny-haired child
besought him in accents with grief rendered wild

why, why, did you pass by my dear papa's grave
i know he was poor, but as kind and as true
as ever marched into the battle with you
his grave is so humble, no stone marks the spot
you may not have seen it. oh, say you did not
for my poor heart will break if you knew he was there
and thought him too lowly your offerings to share
he didn't die lowly--he poured his heart's blood
in rich crimson streams, from the top-crowning sod
of the breastworks which stood in front of the fight
and died shouting, 'onward! for god and the right
o'er all his dead comrades your bright garlands wave
but you haven't put _one_ on _my_ papa's grave
if mamma were here--but she lies by his side
her wearied heart broke when our dear papa died

then up in his arms from the hot, dusty street
he lifted the maiden, while in through the gate
the long line repasses, and many an eye
pays fresh tribute of tears to the lone orphan's sigh
they lie close together, with just room for me
a love pure as this makes these graves hallowed ground

the kindness you've shown little daisy to-day
but i'll pray for you here, each day while i live
i shall see papa soon and dear mamma, too
i dreamed so last night, and i know 'twill come true
and they will both bless you, i know, when i say
how you folded your arms round their dear one to-day
how you cheered her sad heart and soothed it to rest
and hushed its wild throbs on your strong, noble breast
and when the kind angels shall call _you_ to come
we'll welcome you there to our beautiful home
where death never comes his black banners to wave
and the beautiful flowers ne'er weep o'er a grave



two little stockings hung side by side
close to the fireside broad and wide
loaded with toys and many a game

there's only one little girl lives here
so he crept up close to the chimney place
and measured a sock with a sober face
just then a wee little note fell out
and fluttered low, like a bird, about

as he pushed his specs up close to his eyes
and read the address in a child's rough plan
i have hung up for a child named clara hall

so i thought, perhaps, you kindly would
fill up her stocking, too, to-night
and help to make her christmas bright
if you've not enough for both stockings there
please put all in clara's, i shall not care

saint nicholas brushed a tear from his eye
and, "god bless you, darling," he said with a sigh
then softly he blew through the chimney high
a note like a bird's, as it soars on high
when down came two of the funniest mortals
that ever were seen this side earth's portals

all a little girl wants where money is rare
then, oh, what a scene there was in that room
away went the elves, but down from the gloom
of the sooty old chimney came tumbling low
a child's whole wardrobe, from head to toe

how santa clans laughed, as he gathered them in
and fastened each one to the sock with a pin
right to the toe he hung a blue dress
said saint nicholas, smoothing the folds of blue
and tying the hood to the stocking, too

when all the warm clothes were fastened on
and both little socks were filled and done
then santa claus tucked a toy here and there
and hurried away to the frosty air
saying, "god pity the poor, and bless the dear child
who pities them, too, on this night so wild

the wind caught the words and bore them on high
till they died away in the midnight sky
while saint nicholas flew through the icy air
bringing "peace and good will" with him everywhere



i have a rendezvous with death
at some disputed barricade
when spring comes back with rustling shade
and apple-blossoms fill the air
i have a rendezvous with death
when spring brings back blue days and fair

it may be he shall take my hand
and lead me into his dark land
and close my eyes and quench my breath
it may be i shall pass him still
i have a rendezvous with death
on some scarred slope of battered hill
when spring comes round again this year
and the first meadow-flowers appear

god knows't were better to be deep
pillowed in silk and scented down
where love throbs out in blissful sleep
pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath
where hushed awakenings are dear
but i've a rendezvous with death
at midnight in some flaming town
when spring trips north again this year
and i to my pledged word am true
i shall not fail that rendezvous



let us be kind
the way is long and lonely
and human hearts are asking for this blessing only
that we be kind
we cannot know the grief that men may borrow
we cannot see the souls storm-swept by sorrow
but love can shine upon the way to-day, to-morrow
let us be kind

let us be kind
this is a wealth that has no measure
this is of heaven and earth the highest treasure
let us be kind
a tender word, a smile of love in meeting
a song of hope and victory to those retreating
a glimpse of god and brotherhood while life is fleeting
let us be kind

let us be kind
around the world the tears of time are falling
and for the loved and lost these human hearts are calling
let us be kind
to age and youth let gracious words be spoken
upon the wheel of pain so many lives are broken
we live in vain who give no tender token
let us be kind

let us be kind
the sunset tints will soon be in the west
too late the flowers are laid then on the quiet breast
let us be kind
and when the angel guides have sought and found us
their hands shall link the broken ties of earth that bound us
and heaven and home shall brighten all around us
let us be kind



oh! listen to the water mill, through all the livelong day
as the clicking of the wheels wears hour by hour away
how languidly the autumn wind does stir the withered leaves
as in the fields the reapers sing, while binding up their sheaves
a solemn proverb strikes my mind, and as a spell is cast

the summer winds revive no more leaves strewn o'er earth and main
the sickle nevermore will reap the yellow garnered grain
the rippling stream flows on--aye, tranquil, deep and still
but never glideth back again to busy water mill
the solemn proverb speaks to all with meaning deep and vast

ah! clasp the proverb to thy soul, dear loving heart and true
for golden years are fleeting by and youth is passing too
ah! learn to make the most of life, nor lose one happy day
for time will ne'er return sweet joys neglected, thrown away
nor leave one tender word unsaid, thy kindness sow broadcast

oh! the wasted hours of life, that have swiftly drifted by
alas! the good we might have done, all gone without a sigh
love that we might once have saved by a single kindly word
thoughts conceived, but ne'er expressed, perishing unpenned, unheard
oh! take the lesson to thy soul, forever clasp it fast

work on while yet the sun doth shine, thou man of strength and will
the streamlet ne'er doth useless glide by clicking water mill
nor wait until to-morrow's light beams brightly on thy way
for all that thou canst call thine own lies in the phrase "to-day
possession, power and blooming health must all be lost at last

oh! love thy god and fellowman, thyself consider last
for come it will when thou must scan dark errors of the past
soon will this fight of life be o'er and earth recede from view
and heaven in all its glory shine, where all is pure and true
ah! then thou'lt see more clearly still the proverb deep and vast



what makes the dog's nose always cold
i'll try to tell you, curls of gold
if you will good and quiet be
and come and stand by mamma's knee
well, years and years and years ago
how many i don't really know
there came a rain on sea and shore
its like was never seen before
or since. it fell unceasing down
till all the world began to drown
but just before it began to pour
an old, old man--his name was noah
built him an ark, that he might save
his family from a wat'ry grave
and in it also he designed
to shelter two of every kind
of beast. well, dear, when it was done
and heavy clouds obscured the sun
the noah folks to it quickly ran
and then the animals began
to gravely march along in pairs
the leopards, tigers, wolves and bears
the deer, the hippopotamuses
the rabbits, squirrels, elks, walruses
the camels, goats, cats and donkeys
the tall giraffes, the beavers, monkeys
the rats, the big rhinoceroses
the dromedaries and the horses
the sheep, and mice and kangaroos
hyenas, elephants, koodoos
and hundreds more-'twould take all day
my dear, so many names to say
and at the very, very end
of the procession, by his friend
and master, faithful dog was seen
the livelong time he'd helping been
to drive the crowd of creatures in
and now, with loud, exultant bark
he gaily sprang abroad the ark
alas! so crowded was the space
he could not in it find a place
so, patiently, he turned about
stood half way in, half way out
and those extremely heavy showers
descended through nine hundred hours
and more; and, darling, at the close
and never could it lose again
the dampness of that dreadful rain
and that is what, my curls of gold
made all the doggies' noses cold


chained in the market-place he stood
a man of giant frame
amid the gathering multitude
that shrunk to hear his name
all stern of look and strong of limb
his dark eye on the ground
and silently they gazed on him
as on a lion bound

vainly, but well, that chief had fought
he was a captive now
yet pride, that fortune humbles not
was written on his brow
the scars his dark broad bosom wore
showed warrior true and brave
a prince among his tribe before
he could not be a slave

then to his conqueror he spake
undo this necklace from my neck
and take this bracelet ring
and send me where my brother reigns
and i will fill thy hands
with store of ivory from the plains
and gold-dust from the sands

will i unbind thy chain
that bloody hand shall never hold
the battle-spear again
a price thy nation never gave
shall yet be paid for thee
for thou shalt be the christian's slave
in lands beyond the sea

then wept the warrior chief and bade
to shred his locks away
and one by one, each heavy braid
before the victor lay
thick were the platted locks, and long
and deftly hidden there
shone many a wedge of gold among
the dark and crispèd hair

long kept for sorest need
take it--thou askest sums untold
and say that i am freed
take it--my wife, the long, long day
weeps by the cocoa-tree
and my young children leave their play
and ask in vain for me

thy fetters fast and strong
and ween that by the cocoa shade
thy wife will wait thee long
strong was the agony that shook
the captive's frame to hear
and the proud meaning of his look
was changed to mortal fear

his heart was broken--crazed his brain
at once his eye grew wild
he struggled fiercely with his chain
whispered, and wept, and smiled
yet wore not long those fatal bands
and once, at shut of day
they drew him forth upon the sands
the foul hyena's prey




he who lives the golden dream lives fourfold thereby
time may scoff and worlds may laugh, hosts assail his thought
but the visionary came ere the builders wrought
ere the tower bestrode the dome, ere the dome the arch
he, the dreamer of the dream, saw the vision march

he who has the vision hears more than you may hear
unseen lips from unseen worlds are bent unto his ear
from the hills beyond the clouds messages are borne
drifting on the dews of dream to his heart of morn
time awaits and ages stay till he wakes and shows
glimpses of the larger life that his vision knows

he who has the vision feels more than you may feel
joy beyond the narrow joy in whose realm we reel
for he knows the stars are glad, dawn and middleday
in the jocund tide that sweeps dark and dusk away
he who has the vision lives round and all complete
and through him alone we draw dews from combs of sweet



the children kept coming one by one
till the boys were five and the girls were three
and the big brown house was alive with fun
from the basement floor to the old roof-tree
like garden flowers the little ones grew
nurtured and trained with tenderest care
warmed by love's sunshine, bathed in dew
they blossomed into beauty rare

but one of the boys grew weary one day
and leaning his head on his mother's breast
he said, "i am tired and cannot play
let me sit awhile on your knee and rest
she cradled him close to her fond embrace
she hushed him to sleep with her sweetest song
and rapturous love still lightened his face
when his spirit had joined the heavenly throng

then the eldest girl, with her thoughtful eyes
who stood where the "brook and the river meet
stole softly away into paradise
e'er "the river" had reached her slender feet
while the father's eyes on the graves were bent
the mother looked upward beyond the skies
our darlings were angels in earth's disguise

the years flew by, and the children began
with longings to think of the world outside
and as each in turn became a man
the boys proudly went from the father's side
the girls were women so gentle and fair
that lovers were speedy to woo and to win
and with orange-blooms in their braided hair
their old home they left, new homes to begin

so, one by one the children have gone
the boys were five, the girls were three
and the big brown house is gloomy and alone
with but two old folks for its company
they talk to each other about the past
as they sit together at eventide
and say, "all the children we keep at last
are the boy and girl who in childhood died



between broad fields of wheat and corn
is the lowly home where i was born
the peach-tree leans against the wall
and the woodbine wanders over all
there is the shaded doorway still
but a stranger's foot has crossed the sill

there is the barn--and, as of yore
i can smell the hay from the open door
and see the busy swallows throng
and hear the pewee's mournful song
but the stranger comes--oh! painful proof
his sheaves are piled to the heated roof

there is the orchard--the very trees
where my childhood knew long hours of ease
and watched the shadowy moments run
till my life imbibed more shade than sun
the swing from the bough still sweeps the air
but the stranger's children are swinging there

there bubbles the shady spring below
with its bulrush brook where the hazels grow
and watched the minnows poise and shoot
and heard the robin lave his wing
but the stranger's bucket is at the spring

oh, ye who daily cross the sill
step lightly, for i love it still
and when you crowd the old barn eaves
then think what countless harvest sheaves
have passed within' that scented door
to gladden eyes that are no more

deal kindly with these orchard trees
and when your children crowd your knees
their sweetest fruit they shall impart
as if old memories stirred their heart
to youthful sport still leave the swing
and in sweet reverence hold the spring



well, wife, i've found the _model_ church! i worshiped there to-day
it made me think of good old times before my hair was gray
the meetin'-house was fixed up more than they were years ago
but then i felt, when i went in, it wasn't built for show

the sexton didn't seat me away back by the door
he knew that i was old and deaf, as well as old and poor
he must have been a christian, for he led me boldly through
the long aisle of that crowded church to find a pleasant pew

i wish you'd heard that singin'; it had the old-time ring
the preacher said, with trumpet voice: "let all the people sing
the tune was "coronation," and the music upward rolled
till i thought i heard the angels striking all their harps of gold

my deafness seemed to melt away; my spirit caught the fire
i joined my feeble, trembling voice with that melodious choir
and sang as in my youthful days: "let angels prostrate fall
bring forth the royal diadem, and crown him lord of all

i tell you, wife, it did me good to sing that hymn once more
i felt like some wrecked mariner who gets a glimpse of shore
i almost wanted to lay down this weatherbeaten form
and anchor in that blessed port forever from the storm

i know it wasn't written; i know it wasn't read
he hadn't time to read it, for the lightnin' of his eye
went flashin' long from pew to pew, nor passed a sinner by

the sermon wasn't flowery; 'twas simple gospel truth
it fitted poor old men like me; it fitted hopeful youth

the preacher made sin hideous in gentiles and in jews
he shot the golden sentences down in the finest pews
and--though i can't see very well--i saw the falling tear
that told me hell was some ways off, and heaven very near

how swift the golden moments fled within that holy place
how brightly beamed the light of heaven from every happy face
again i longed for that sweet time when friend shall meet with friend

i hope to meet that minister--that congregation, too
in that dear home beyond the stars that shine from heaven's blue
i doubt not i'll remember, beyond life's evenin' gray
the happy hour of worship in that model church today

dear wife, the fight will soon be fought; the vict'ry soon be won
the shinin' goal is just ahead; the race is nearly run
o'er the river we are nearin', they are throngin' to the shore
to shout our safe arrival where the weary weep no more



the gret big church wuz crowded full uv broadcloth an' of silk
an' satins rich as cream thet grows on our ol' brindle's milk
shined boots, biled shirts, stiff dickeys, an' stove-pipe hats were there
an' doodes 'ith trouserloons so tight they couldn't kneel down in prayer

the elder in his poolpit high, said, as he slowly riz
an' as we hev no substitoot, as brother moore ain't here
will some 'un in the congregation be so kind's to volunteer

an' then a red-nosed, blear-eyed tramp, of low-toned, rowdy style
give an interductory hiccup, an' then swaggered up the aisle
then thro' that holy atmosphere there crep' a sense er sin
an' thro' thet air of sanctity the odor uv ol' gin

then deacon purington he yelled, his teeth all set on edge
the tramp didn' hear a word he said, but slouched 'ith stumblin' feet
an' stalked an' swaggered up the steps, an' gained the organ seat

he then went pawin' thro' the keys, an' soon there rose a strain
thet seemed to jest bulge out the heart, an' 'lectrify the brain
an' then he slapped down on the thing 'ith hands an' head an' knees
he slam-dashed his hull body down kerflop upon the keys

the organ roared, the music flood went sweepin' high an' dry
it swelled into the rafters, an' bulged out into the sky
the ol' church shook and staggered, an' seemed to reel an' sway
an' the elder shouted "glory!" an' i yelled out "hooray

an' then he tried a tender strain that melted in our ears
thet brought up blessed memories and drenched 'em down 'ith tears
an' we dreamed uv ol' time kitchens, 'ith tabby on the mat
uv home an' luv an' baby days, an' mother, an' all that

an' then he struck a streak uv hope--a song from souls forgiven
thet burst from prison bars uv sin, an' stormed the gates uv heaven
the morning stars together sung--no soul wuz left alone
we felt the universe wuz safe, an' god was on his throne

an' then a wail of deep despair an' darkness come again
an' long, black crape hung on the doors uv all the homes uv men
no luv, no light, no joy, no hope, no songs of glad delight
an' then--the tramp, he swaggered down an' reeled out into the night

but we knew he'd tol' his story, tho' he never spoke a word
an' it was the saddest story thet our ears had ever heard
he had tol' his own life history, an' no eye was dry thet day
w'en the elder rose an' simply said: "my brethren, let up pray



there lay upon the ocean's shore
what once a tortoise served to cover
a year and more, with rush and roar
the surf had rolled it over
had played with it, and flung it by
as wind and weather might decide it
then tossed it high where sand-drifts dry
cheap burial might provide it
it rested there to bleach or tan
the rains had soaked, the suns had burned it
with many a ban the fisherman
had stumbled o'er and spurned it
and there the fisher-girl would stay
conjecturing with her brother
how in their play the poor estray
might serve some use or other

so there it lay, through wet and dry
as empty as the last new sonnet
till by and by came mercury
and, having mused upon it
in shape, material, and dimension
give it but strings, and, lo, it sings
a wonderful invention

so said, so done; the chords he strained
and, as his fingers o'er them hovered
the shell disdained a soul had gained
the lyre had been discovered
o empty world that round us lies
dead shell, of soul and thought forsaken
brought we but eyes like mercury's
in thee what songs should waken




the old mayor climbed the belfry tower
the ringers rang by two, by three
good ringers, pull your best," quoth he
play all your changes, all your swells
play uppe 'the brides of enderby

men say it was a stolen tyde
the lord that sent it, he knows all
but in myne ears doth still abide
the message that the bells let fall
and there was naught of strange, beside
the flight of mews ans peewits pied
by millions crouched on the old sea-wall

i sat and spun within the doore
my thread break off, i raised myne eyes
the level sun, like ruddy ore
lay sinking in the barren skies
and dark against day's golden death
she moved where lindis wandereth
my sonne's faire wife, elizabeth

ere the early dews were falling
farre away i heard her song
where the reedy lindis floweth
floweth, floweth
from the meads where melick groweth
faintly came her milking song

leave your meadow grasses mellow
mellow, mellow
quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow
come uppe whitefoot, come uppe lightfoot
quit the stalks of parsley hollow
hollow, hollow
come uppe jetty, rise and follow
from the clovers lift your head
come uppe whitefoot, come uppe lightfoot
come uppe jetty, rise and follow
jetty, to the milking shed

if it be long, ay, long ago
when i beginne to think howe long
againe i hear the lindis flow
swift as an arrowe, sharp and strong
and all the aire, it seemeth mee
bin full of floating bells (sayeth she
that ring the tune of enderby

alle fresh the level pasture lay
and not a shadowe mote be seene
save where full fyve good miles away
the steeple towered from out the greene
and lo! the great bell farre and wide
was heard in all the country side
that saturday at eventide

the swanherds where there sedges are
moved on in sunset's golden breath
the shepherde lads i heard affare
and my sonne's wife, elizabeth
till floating o'er the grassy sea
came down that kindly message free
the "brides of mavis enderby

then some looked uppe into the sky
and all along where lindis flows
to where the goodly vessels lie
and where the lordly steeple shows
they sayde, "and why should this thing be
what danger lowers by land or sea
they ring the tune of enderby

of pyrate galleys warping downe
for shippes ashore beyond the scorpe
they have not spared to wake the towne
but while the west bin red to see
and storms be none, and pyrates flee
why ring 'the brides of enderby

i looked without, and lo! my sonne
came riding down with might and main
he raised a shout as he drew on
till all the welkin rang again
than my sonne's wife, elizabeth

the rising tide comes on apace
and boats adrift in yonder towne
go sailing uppe the market-place
he shook as one that looks on death

with her two bairns i marked her long
and ere yon bells beganne to play
afar i heard her milking song
he looked across the grassy lea
to right, to left, "ho, enderby
they rang "the brides of enderby

with that he cried and beat his breast
for, lo! along the river's bed
a mighty eygre reared his crest
and uppe the lindis raging sped
it swept with thunderous noises loud
shaped like a curling snow-white cloud
or like a demon in a shroud

and rearing lindis backward pressed
shook all her trembling bankes amaine
then madly at the eygre's breast
flung uppe her weltering walls again
then bankes came downe with ruin and rout
then beaten foam flew round about
then all the mighty floods were out

so farre, so fast the eygre drave
the heart had hardly time to beat
before a shallow seething wave
sobbed in the grasses at oure feet
the feet had hardly time to flee
before it brake against the knee
and all the world was in the sea

upon the roofe we sat that night
the noise of bells went sweeping by
i marked the lofty beacon light
stream from the church tower, red and high
a lurid mark and dread to see
and awesome bells they were to mee
that in the dark rang "enderby

they rang the sailor lads to guide
from roofe to roofe who fearless rowed
and i--my sonne was at my side
and yet the ruddy beacon glowed
and yet he moaned beneath his breath
oh, lost! my love, elizabeth

and didst thou visit him no more
thou didst, thou didst, my daughter deare
the waters laid thee at his doore
ere yet the early dawn was clear
thy pretty bairns in fast embrace
the lifted sun shone on thy face
downe drifted to thy dwelling-place

that flow strewed wrecks about the grass
that ebbe swept out the flocks to sea
a fatal ebbe and flow, alas
to manye more than myne and me
but each will mourn his own (she saith
and sweeter woman ne'er drew breath
than my sonne's wife, elizabeth

i shall never hear her more
by the reedy lindis shore
ere the early dews be falling
i shall never hear her song
where the sunny lindis floweth
goeth, floweth
from the meads where melick groweth
when the water winding down
onward floweth to the town

i shall never see her more
where the reeds and rushes quiver
shiver, quiver
stand beside the sobbing river
sobbing, throbbing, in its falling
to the sandy lonesome shore
i shall never hear her calling
mellow, mellow
quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow
come uppe whitefoot, come uppe lightfoot
quit your pipes of parsley hollow
hollow, hollow
come uppe lightfoot, rise and follow
lightfoot, whitefoot
from your clovers lift the head
come uppe jetty, follow, follow
jetty, to the milking-shed



o month of fairer, rarer days
than summer's best have been
when skies at noon are burnished blue
and winds at evening keen
when tangled, tardy-blooming things
from wild waste places peer
and drooping golden grain-heads tell
that harvest-time is near

though autumn tints amid the green
are gleaming, here and there
and spicy autumn odors float
like incense on the air
and sounds we mark as autumn's own
her nearing steps betray
in gracious mood she seems to stand
and bid the summer stay

though 'neath the trees, with fallen leaves
the sward be lightly strown
and nests deserted tell the tale
of summer bird-folk flown
though white with frost the lowlands lie
when lifts the morning haze
still there's a charm in every hour
of sweet september days



who comes dancing over the snow
his soft little feet all bare and rosy
open the door, though the wild wind blow
take the child in and make him cozy
take him in and hold him dear
here is the wonderful glad new year




if you can dress to make yourself attractive
yet not make puffs and curls your chief delight
if you can swim and row, be strong and active
but of the gentler graces lose not sight
if you can dance without a craze for dancing
play without giving play too strong a hold
enjoy the love of friends without romancing
care for the weak, the friendless and the old

if you can master french and greek and latin
and not acquire, as well, a priggish mien
if you can feel the touch of silk and satin
without despising calico and jean
if you can ply a saw and use a hammer
can do a man's work when the need occurs
can sing when asked, without excuse or stammer
can rise above unfriendly snubs and slurs

if you can make good bread as well as fudges
can sew with skill and have an eye for dust
if you can be a friend and hold no grudges
a girl whom all will love because they must

if sometime you should meet and love another
and make a home with faith and peace enshrined
and you its soul--a loyal wife and mother
you'll work out pretty nearly to my mind
the plan that's been developed through the ages
and win the best that life can have in store
you'll be, my girl, the model for the sages
a woman whom the world will bow before



little lass of plymouth,--gentle, shy, and sweet
primly, trimly tripping down the queer old street
homespun frock and apron, clumsy buckled shoe
skirts that reach your ankles, just as mother's do
bonnet closely clinging over braid and curl
modest little maiden,--plymouth's pilgrim girl

little lad of plymouth, stanchly trudging by
strong your frame, and sturdy; kind and keen your eye
clad in belted doublet, buckles at your knee
every garment fashioned as a man's might be
shoulder-cloak and breeches, hat with bell-shaped crown
manly little pilgrim,--boy of plymouth town

boy and girl of plymouth, brave and blithe, and true
finer task than yours was, children never knew
sharing toil and hardship in the strange, new land
hope, and help, and promise of the weary band
grave the life around you, scant its meed of joy
yours to make it brighter,--pilgrim girl and boy



thank god for the might of it
the ardor, the urge, the delight of it
work that springs from the heart's desire
setting the brain and the soul on fire
oh, what is so good as the heat of it
and what is so glad as the beat of it
and what is so kind as the stern command
challenging brain and heart and hand

thank god for the pride of it
for the beautiful, conquering tide of it
sweeping the life in its furious flood
thrilling the arteries, cleansing the blood
mastering stupor and dull despair
moving the dreamer to do and dare
oh, what is so good as the urge of it
and what is so glad as the surge of it
and what is so strong as the summons deep
rousing the torpid soul from sleep

thank god for the pace of it
for the terrible, swift, keen race of it
fiery steeds in full control
nostrils a-quiver to reach the goal
work, the power that drives behind
guiding the purposes, taming the mind
holding the runaway wishes back
reining the will to one steady track
speeding the energies, faster, faster
triumphing ever over disaster
oh, what is so good as the pain of it
and what is so great as the gain of it
and what is so kind as the cruel goad
forcing us on through the rugged road

thank god for the swing of it
for the clamoring, hammering ring of it
passion of labor daily hurled
on the mighty anvils of the world
oh, what is so fierce as the flame of it
and what is so huge as the aim of it
thundering on through dearth and doubt
calling the plan of the maker out
work, the titan; work, the friend
shaping the earth to a glorious end
draining the swamps and blasting hills
doing whatever the spirit wills
rending a continent apart
to answer the dream of the master heart
thank god for a world where none may shirk
thank god for the splendor of work



ask for

you say i have asked for the costliest thing
ever made by the hand above
a woman's heart and a woman's life
and a woman's wonderful love

that i have written your duty out
and, man-like, have questioned free
you demand that i stand at the bar of your soul
while you in turn question me

and when i ask you to be my wife
the head of my house and home
whose path i would scatter with sunshine through life
thy shield when sorrow shall come

you reply with disdain and a curl of the lip
and point to my coat's missing button
and haughtily ask if i want a _cook
to serve up my _beef_ and my _mutton

but only a plain, earnest man
whose feet often shun the hard path they should tread
often shrink from the gulf they should span

from the cheek so full, so fair
was ever reflected there

true, the rose will fade, and the leaves will fall
and the autumn of life will come
but the heart that i give thee will be true as in may
should i make it thy shelter, thy home

thou requir'st "all things that are good and true
all things that a man should be
ah! lady, my _truth_, in return, doubt not
for the rest, i leave it to thee



i cannot vouch my tale is true
nor say, indeed, 'tis wholly new
but true or false, or new or old
i think you'll find it fairly told
a frenchman, who had ne'er before
set foot upon a foreign shore
weary of home, resolved to go
and see what holland had to show
he didn't know a word of dutch
but that could hardly grieve him much
he thought, as frenchmen always do
that all the world could "parley-voo
at length our eager tourist stands
within the famous netherlands
and, strolling gaily here and there
in search of something rich or rare
a lordly mansion greets his eyes
and, bowing to the man who sate
in livery at the garden gate
whose very charming grounds are these
and, pardon me, be pleased to tell
who in this splendid house may dwell
to which, in dutch, the puzzled man
replied what seemed like "nick van stann

is equally superb and chaste
so fine a house, upon my word
not even paris can afford
with statues, too, in every niche
of course monsieur van stann is rich
and lives, i warrant, like a king
ah! wealth mast be a charming thing
in amsterdam the frenchman meets
a thousand wonders in the streets
but most he marvels to behold
a lady dressed in silk and gold
gazing with rapture on the dame
he begs to know the lady's name
and hears, to raise his wonders more
the very words he heard before
milord has got a charming wife
must be a very happy man

next day our tourist chanced to pop
his head within a lottery shop
and there he saw, with staring eyes
the drawing of the mammoth prize
i wish i had as much at home
i'd like to know, as i'm a sinner
what lucky fellow is the winner
conceive our traveler's amaze
to hear again the hackneyed phrase
faith! he's the luckiest of men
you may be sure we don't advance
so rapidly as that in france
a house, the finest in the land
a lovely garden, nicely planned
a perfect angel of a wife
and gold enough to last a life
there never yet was mortal man
so blest--as monsieur nick van stann

next day the frenchman chanced to meet
a pompous funeral in the street
and, asking one who stood close by
what nobleman had pleased to die
was stunned to hear the old reply
the frenchman sighed and shook his head
with such a house, and such a wife
it must be hard to part with life
and then, to lose that mammoth prize
he wins, and, pop,--the winner dies
ah, well! his blessings came so fast
i greatly feared they could not last
and thus, we see, the sword of fate
cuts down alike the small and great




marching down to armageddon
brothers, stout and strong
let us cheer the way we tread on
with a soldier's song
faint we by the weary road
or fall we in the rout
dirge or pæan, death or triumph
let the song ring out

we are they who scorn the scorners
love the lovers--hate
none within the world's four corners
all must share one fate
we are they whose common banner
bears no badge nor sign
save the light which dyes it white
the hope that makes it shine

we are they whose bugle rings
that all the wars may cease
we are they will pay the kings
their cruel price for peace
we are they whose steadfast watchword
is what christ did teach
and heaven, then, for each

we are they who will not falter
many swords or few
till we make this earth the altar
of a worship new
we are they who will not take
from palace, priest or code
a meaner law than "brotherhood
a lower lord than god

marching down to armageddon
brothers, stout and strong
ask not why the way we tread on
is so rough and long
god will tell us when our spirits
grow to grasp his plan
let us do our part to-day
and help him, helping man

shall we even curse the madness
which for "ends of state
dooms us to the long, long sadness
of this human hate
let us slay in perfect pity
those that must not live
vanquish, and forgive our foes
or fall--and still forgive

we are those whose unpaid legions
in free ranks arrayed
massacred in many regions
never once were stayed
we are they whose torn battalions
trained to bleed, not fly
make our agonies a triumph
conquer, while we die

therefore, down to armageddon
brothers, bold and strong
cheer the glorious way we tread on
with this soldier song
let the armies of the old flags
march in silent dread
death and life are one to us
who fight for quick and dead



it was a sergeant old and gray
well singed and bronzed from siege and pillage
went tramping in an army's wake
along the turnpike of the village

for days and nights the winding host
had through the little place been marching
and ever loud the rustics cheered
till every throat was hoarse and parching

the squire and farmer, maid and dame
all took the sight's electric stirring
and hats were waved and staves were sung
and kerchiefs white were countless whirring

they only saw a gallant show
of heroes stalwart under banners
and, in the fierce heroic glow

the sergeant heard the shrill hurrahs
where he behind in step was keeping
but, glancing down beside the road
he saw a little maid sit weeping

a moment pausing to regard her
and then she only cried the harder

the sturdy trooper straight repeated
that you, in tears, apart are seated

and that's a sight, my baby beauty
to quicken silence into song
and glorify the soldier's duty

the little maid gave soft replying
all say 'hurrah' while i am crying

how many little sisters' brothers
are going all away to fight
and may be killed, as well as others

his brawny hand her curls caressing
to find that war's not all a blessing

and "bless thee!" once again he cried
then cleared his throat and looked indignant
and marched away with wrinkled brow
to stop the struggling tear benignant

and still the ringing shouts went up
from doorway, thatch, and fields of tillage
the pall behind the standard seen
by one alone of all the village

the oak and cedar bend and writhe
when roars the wind through gap and braken
but 'tis the tenderest reed of all
that trembles first when earth is shaken



once in persia reigned a king
who upon his signet ring
graved a maxim true and wise
which, if held before his eyes
gave him counsel at a glance
fit for every change and chance
solemn words; and these are they

trains of camels through the sand
brought him gems from samarcand
fleets of galleys through the seas
brought him pearls to match with these
but he counted not his gain
treasurer of the mine and main

in the revels of his court
at the zenith of the sport
when the palms of all his guests
burned with clapping at his jests
he, amid his figs and wine
cried: "o loving friends of mine
pleasures come, but not to stay
even this shall pass away

fighting on a furious field
once a javelin pierced his shield
soldiers with loud lament
bore him bleeding to his tent
groaning with his tortured side
even this shall pass away

struck with palsy, sere and old
waiting at the gates of gold
spake he with his dying breath
then, in answer to the king
fell a sunbeam on his ring
showing by a heavenly ray



you're going to leave the homestead, john
you're twenty-one to-day
and very sorry am i, john
to see you go away
you've labored late and early, john
and done the best you could
i ain't going to stop you, john
i wouldn't if i could

yet something of your feelings, john
i s'pose i'd ought to know
though many a day has passed away
when hope was high within me, john
and life lay all before
that i, with strong and measured stroke

the years they come and go, my boy
the years they come and go
and raven locks and tresses brown
grow white as driven snow
my life has known its sorrows, john
its trials and troubles sore
yet god withal has blessed me, john

but one thing let me tell you, john
before you make a start
there's more in being honest, john
twice o'er than being smart
though rogues may seem to flourish, john
and sterling worth to fail
oh! keep in view the good and true

don't think too much of money, john
and dig and delve and plan
and rake and scrape in every shape
to hoard up all you can
though fools may count their riches, john
in dollars and in cents
the best of wealth is youth and health
and good sound common sense

and don't be mean and stingy, john
but lay a little by
of what you earn; you soon will learn
how fast 'twill multiply
so when old age comes creeping on
you'll have a goodly store
of wealth to furnish all your needs
and maybe something more

there's shorter cuts to fortune, john
we see them every day
but those who save their self-respect
climb up the good old way
and makes the vulgar stare
and those we deem the richest, john
have oft the least to spare

don't meddle with your neighbors, john
their sorrows or their cares
you'll find enough to do, my boy
to mind your own affairs
the world is full of idle tongues
you can afford to shirk
there's lots of people ready, john
to do such dirty work

and if amid the race for fame
you win a shining prize
the humbler work of honest men
you never should despise
for each one has his mission, john
in life's unchanging plan
though lowly be his station, john
he is no less a man

be good, be pure, be noble, john
be honest, brave, be true
and do to others as you would
that they should do to you
and put your trust in god, my boy
though fiery darts be hurled
then you can smile at satan's rage
and face a frowning world

good-by! may heaven guard and bless
your footsteps day by day
the old house will be lonesome, john
when you are gone away
the cricket's song upon the hearth
will have a sadder tone
the old familiar spots will be
so lonely when you're gone


king alphonso of asturias had imprisoned the count saldana, about the
time of the birth of the count's son bernardo. in an effort to secure
his father's release, bernardo, when old enough, took up arms. finally
the king offered bernardo possession of his father's person, in exchange
for the castle of carpio and all the king's subjects there imprisoned
the cruel trick played by the king on bernardo is here described

the warrior bowed his crested head, and tamed his heart of fire
and sued the haughty king to free his long-imprisoned sire
i pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord!--oh break my father's chain
mount thy good horse; and thou and i will meet him on his way

then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his steed
and urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger's foamy speed
and lo! from far, as on they pressed, there came a glittering band
with one that midst them stately rode, as leader in the land
the father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned so long to see

his dark eye flashed, his proud breast heaved, his cheek's hue came and
he reached that gray-haired chieftain's side, and there, dismounting, bent
a lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he took
what was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook
that hand was cold,--a frozen thing,--it dropped from his like lead
he looked up to the face above,--the face was of the dead
a plume waved o'er the noble brow,--the brow was fixed and white
he met, at last, his father's eyes, but in them was no sight

up from the ground he sprang and gazed, but who could paint that gaze
they hushed their very hearts that saw its horror and amaze
they might have chained him, as before that stony form he stood
for the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip the blood
talk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of warlike men

he thought on all his glorious hopes, and all his young renown
he flung the falchion from his side, and in the dust sat down
then covering with his steel-gloved hands his darkly mournful brow
my king is false, my hope betrayed, my father--oh, the worth
the glory, and the loveliness, are passed away from earth
i thought to stand where banners waved, my sire, beside thee, yet
i would that there our kindred blood on spain's free soil had met
thou wouldst have known my spirit then;--for thee my fields were won
and thou hast perished in thy chains, as though thou hadst no son

then, starting from the ground once more, he seized the monarch's rein
amidst the pale and 'wildered looks of all the courtier train
and, with a fierce, o'ermastering grasp, the rearing war-horse led
and sternly set them face to face, the king before the dead
be still, and gaze thou on, false king! and tell me what is this
the voice, the glance, the heart i sought--give answer, where are they
if thou wouldst clear thy perjured soul, send life through this cold clay
into these glassy eyes put light; be still! keep down thine ire
bid these white lips a blessing speak, this earth is not my sire
give me back him for whom i strove, for whom my blood was shed
thou canst not?--and a king!--his dust be mountains on thy head

he loosed the steed--his slack hand fell; upon the silent face
he cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turned from that sad place
his hope was crushed, his after fate untold in martial strain
his banner led the spears no more, amidst the hills of spain



go thou thy way, and i go mine
apart--but not afar
only a thin veil hangs between
the pathways where we are
and god keep watch 'tween thee and me
this is my prayer
he looks thy way--he looketh mine
and keeps us near

i know not where thy road may lie
nor which way mine will be
if thine will lead through parching sands
and mine beside the sea
yet god keeps watch 'tween thee and me
so never fear
he holds thy hand--he claspeth mine
and keeps us near

should wealth and fame perchance be thine
and my lot lowly be
or you be sad and sorrowful
and glory be for me
yet god keep watch 'tween thee and me
both are his care
one arm round me and one round thee
will keep us near

i sigh sometimes to see thy face
but since this may not be
i leave thee to the love of him
who cares for thee and me
this comforts--dear
one wing o'er thee--and one o'er me
so we are near

and though our paths be separate
and thy way be not mine
yet coming to the mercy seat
my soul shall meet with thine
and "god keep watch 'tween thee and me
i'll whisper there
he blesses me--he blesses thee
and we are near


o thou eternal one! whose presence bright
all space doth occupy, all motion guide
unchanged through time's all-devastating flight
thou only god--there is no god beside
being above all beings! mighty one
whom none can comprehend and none explore
who fill'st existence with thyself alone
embracing all, supporting, ruling o'er
being whom we call god, and know no more

in its sublime research, philosophy
may measure out the ocean-deep--may count
the sands or the sun's rays--but, god! for thee
there is no weight nor measure; none can mount
up to thy mysteries:* reason's brightest spark
though kindled by thy light, in vain would try
to trace thy counsels, infinite and dark
and thought is lost ere thought can soar so high
even like past moments in eternity

thou from primeval nothingness didst call
first chaos, then existence--lord! in thee
eternity had its foundation; all
sprung forth from thee--of light, joy, harmony
sole origin--all life, all beauty thine
thy word created all, and doth create
thy splendor fills all space with rays divine
thou art and wert and shalt be! glorious! great
light-giving, life-sustaining potentate

thy chains the unmeasured universe surround
upheld by thee, by thee inspired with breath
thou the beginning with the end hast bound
and beautifully mingled life and death
as sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze
so suns are born, so worlds spring forth from thee
and as the spangles in the sunny rays
shine round the silver snow, the pageantry
of heaven's bright army glitters in thy praise

a million torches, lighted by thy hand
wander unwearied through the blue abyss
they own thy power, accomplish thy command
all gay with life, all eloquent with bliss
what shall we call them? piles of crystal light
a glorious company of golden streams
lamps of celestial ether burning bright
suns lighting systems with their joyous beams
but thou to these art as the noon to night

yes! as a drop of water in the sea
all this magnificence in thee is lost
what are ten thousand worlds compared to thee
and what am i then?--heaven's unnumbered host
though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed
in all the glory of sublimest thought
is but an atom in the balance, weighed
against thy greatness--is a cipher brought
against infinity! what am i then? naught

naught! but the effluence of thy light divine
pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too
yes! in my spirit doth thy spirit shine
as shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew
naught! but i live, and on hope's pinions fly
eager toward thy presence; for in thee
i live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high
even to the throne of thy divinity
i am, o god! and surely thou must be

thou art!--directing, guiding all--thou art
direct my understanding then to thee
control my spirit, guide my wandering heart
though but an atom midst immensity
still i am something, fashioned by thy hand
i hold a middle rank 'twixt heaven and earth
on the last verge of mortal being stand
close to the realm where angels have their birth
just on the boundaries of the spirit-land

the chain of being is complete in me
in me is matter's last gradation lost
and the next step is spirit--deity
i can command the lightning, and am dust
a monarch and a slave--a worm, a god
whence came i here, and how? so marvelously
constructed and conceived? unknown! this clod
lives surely through some higher energy
for from itself alone it could not be

creator, yes! thy wisdom and thy word
created me! thou source of life and good
thou spirit of my spirit, and my lord
thy light, thy love, in their bright plenitude
filled me with an immortal soul, to spring
over the abyss of death; and bade it wear
the garments of eternal day, and wing
its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere
even to its source--to thee--its author there

o thoughts ineffable! o visions blest
though worthless our conceptions all of thee
yet shall thy shadowed image fill our breast
and waft its homage to thy deity
god! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar
thus seek thy presence--being wise and good
midst thy vast works admire, obey, adore
and when the tongue is eloquent no more
the soul shall speak in tears of gratitude



the boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but him had fled
the flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone round him o'er the dead

yet beautiful and bright he stood
as born to rule the storm
a creature of heroic blood
a proud, though childlike form

the flames roll'd on--he would not go
without his father's word
that father, faint in death below
his voice no longer heard

he called aloud: "say, father, say
if yet my task is done
he knew not that the chieftain lay
unconscious of his son

and but the booming shots replied
and fast the flames roll'd on

upon his brow he felt their breath
and in his waving hair
and looked from that lone post of death
in still, yet brave despair

and shouted but once more aloud
while o'er him fast, through sail and shroud
the wreathing fires made way

they wrapt the ship in splendor wild
they caught the flag on high
and streamed above the gallant child
like banners in the sky

there came a burst of thunder sound
the boy--oh! where was he
ask of the winds that far around
with fragments strewed the sea

with mast, and helm, and pennon fair
that well had borne their part
but the noblest thing that perished there
was that young, faithful heart



we were not many,--we who stood
before the iron sleet that day
yet many a gallant spirit would
give half his years if he but could
have been with us at monterey

now here, now there, the shot it hailed
in deadly drifts of fiery spray
yet not a single soldier quailed
when wounded comrades round them wailed
their dying shout at monterey

and on, still on our column kept
through walls of flame, its withering way
where fell the dead, the living stept
still charging on the guns which swept
the slippery streets of monterey

the foe himself recoiled aghast
when, striking where he strongest lay
we swooped his flanking batteries past
and braving full their murderous blast
stormed home the towers of monterey

our banners on those turrets wave
and there our evening bugles play
where orange boughs above their grave
keep green the memory of the brave
who fought and fell at monterey

we are not many, we who pressed
beside the brave who fell that day
but who of us has not confessed
he'd rather share their warrior rest
than not have been at monterey



if you can take your dreams into the classroom
and always make them part of each day's work
if you can face the countless petty problems
nor turn from them nor ever try to shirk
if you can live so that the child you work with
deep in his heart knows you to be a man
if you can take "i can't" from out his language
and put in place a vigorous "i can

if you can take love with you to the classroom
and yet on firmness never shut the door
if you can teach a child the love of nature
so that he helps himself to all her store
if you can teach him life is what we make it
that he himself can be his only bar
if you can tell him something of the heavens
or something of the wonder of a star

if you, with simple bits of truth and honor
his better self occasionally reach
and yet not overdo nor have him dub you
as one who is inclined to ever preach
if you impart to him a bit of liking
for all the wondrous things we find in print
yet have him understand that to be happy
play, exercise, fresh air he must not stint

if you can give of all the best that's in you
and in the giving always happy be
if you can find the good that's hidden somewhere
deep in the heart of every child you see
if you can do these things and all the others
that teachers everywhere do every day
you're in the work that you were surely meant for
take hold of it! know it's your place and stay



there were ninety and nine
of a flock, sleek and fine
in a sheltering cote in the vale
but a lamb was away
on the mountain astray
unprotected within the safe pale

then the sleet and the rain
on the mountain and plain
and the wind fiercely blowing a gale
and the night's growing dark
and the wolf's hungry bark
stir the soul of the shepherd so hale

and he says, "hireling, go
for a lamb's in the snow
and exposed to the wild hungry beast
nor to rest weary feet
nor to sit at a bounteous feast

then the hireling replied
all your flock save this one little sheep
are the ninety and nine
all so safe and so fine
not enough for the shepherd to keep

then the shepherd replied
presses near, very near, to my heart
not its value in pay
makes me urge in this way
but the longings and achings of heart

o good shepherd, i pray
for i shudder to go in the dark
on the mountain so high
and its precipice nigh

then the shepherd said, "no
surely some one must go
who can rescue my lamb from the cold
from the wolf's hungry maw
and the lion's fierce paw
and restore it again to the fold

then the shepherd goes out
with his cloak girt about
and his rod and his staff in his hand
what cares he for the cold
if his sheep to the fold
he can bring from the dark mountain land

you can hear his clear voice
as the mountains rejoice
up the hillside so steep
into caverns so deep

now he hears its weak "baa
and he answers it, "ah
sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep
then its answering bleat
hurries on his glad feet
and his arms gather up his lost sheep

wet and cold on his breast
the lost lamb found its rest
as he bore it adown to the fold
and the ninety and nine
bleat for joy down the line
that it's safe from the wolf and the cold

then he said to his friends
for the steeps and the deeps i have crossed
for the pelting of sleet
and my sore, weary feet
for i've found the dear lamb that was lost

let the hirelings upbraid
for the nights that he stayed
on the mountains so rugged and high
surely never a jeer
from my lips shall one hear

while the eons shall roll
o'er my glad ransomed soul
i will praise the good shepherd above
for a place on his breast
for its comfort and rest
for his wonderful, wonderful love



if you have a friend worth loving
love him. yes, and let him know
that you love him ere life's evening
tinge his brow with sunset glow
why should good words ne'er be said
of a friend--till he is dead

if you hear a song that thrills you
sung by any child of song
praise it. do not let the singer
wait deserved praises long
why should one that thrills your heart
lack that joy it may impart

if you hear a prayer that moves you
by its humble pleading tone
join it. do not let the seeker
bow before his god alone
why should not your brother share
the strength of "two or three" in prayer

if you see the hot tears falling
from a loving brother's eyes
share them, and by sharing
own your kinship with the skies
why should anyone be glad
when his brother's heart is sad

if a silver laugh goes rippling
through the sunshine on his face
share it. 'tis the wise man's saying
for both grief and joy a place
there's health and goodness in the mirth
in which an honest laugh has birth

if your work is made more easy
by a friendly helping hand
say so. speak out brave and truly
ere the darkness veil the land
should a brother workman dear
falter for a word of cheer

scatter thus your seed of kindness
all enriching as you go
leave them, trust the harvest-giver
he will make each seed to grow
so, until its happy end
your life shall never lack a friend


you sail and you seek for the fortunate isles
the old greek isles of the yellow bird's song
then steer right on through the watery miles
straight on, straight on, and you can't go wrong
nay, not to the left, nay, not to the right
but on, straight on, and the isles are in sight
the fortunate isles, where the yellow birds sing
and life lies girt with a golden ring

these fortunate isles, they are not far
they lie within reach of the lowliest door
you can see them gleam by the twilight star
you can hear them sing by the moon's white shore
nay, never look back! those leveled gravestones
they were landing steps; they were steps unto thrones
of glory for souls that have sailed before
and have set white feet on the fortunate shore

and what are the names of the fortunate isles
why, duty and love and a large content
lo! there are the isles of the watery miles
that god let down from the firmament
lo! duty and love, and a true man's trust
your forehead to god and your feet in the dust
lo! duty and love, and a sweet babe's smiles
and there, o friend, are the fortunate isles



a foolish little maiden bought a foolish little bonnet
with a ribbon, and a feather, and a bit of lace upon it
and that the other maidens of the little town might know it
she thought she'd go to meeting the next sunday just to show it

but though the little bonnet was scarce larger than a dime
the getting of it settled proved to be a work of time
so when 'twas fairly tied, all the bells had stopped their ringing
and when she came to meeting, sure enough the folks were singing

so this foolish little maiden stood and waited at the door
and she shook her ruffles out behind and smoothed them down before

this made the little maiden feel so very, very cross
that she gave her little mouth a twist, her little head a toss
for she thought the very hymn they sang was all about her bonnet
with the ribbon, and the feather, and the bit of lace upon it

and she would not wait to listen to the sermon or the prayer
but pattered down the silent street, and hurried up the stair
till she reached her little bureau, and in a band-box on it
had hidden, safe from critics' eyes, her foolish little bonnet

which proves, my little maidens, that each of you will find
in every sabbath service but an echo of your mind
and the silly little head, that's filled with silly little airs
will never get a blessing from sermon or from prayers



work thou for pleasure; paint or sing or carve
the thing thou lovest, though the body starve
who works for glory misses oft the goal
who works for money coins his very soul
work for work's sake then, and it well may be
that these things shall be added unto thee



i was strolling one day down the lawther arcade
that place for children's toys
where you can purchase a dolly or spade
for your good little girls and boys
and as i passed a certain stall, said a wee little voice to me
o, i am a colonel in a little cocked hat, and i ride on a tin gee gee
o, i am a colonel in a little cocked hat, and i ride on a tin gee gee

then i looked and a little tin soldier i saw
in his little cocked hat so fine
he'd a little tin sword that shone in the light
as he led a glittering line of tin hussars
whose sabers flashed in a manner à la military
and that little tin soldier he rode at their head
so proud on his tin gee gee

then that little tin soldier he sobbed and he sighed
so i patted his little tin head
and this is what he said
i've been on this stall a very long time
and i'm marked twenty-nine, as you see
whilst just on the shelf above my head
there's a fellow marked sixty-three

now he hasn't got a sword and he hasn't got a horse
and i'm quite as good as he
so why mark me at twenty-nine
and him at sixty-three
there's a pretty little dolly girl over there
and i'm madly in love with she
but now that i'm only marked twenty-nine
she turns up her nose at me
she turns up her little wax nose at me
and carries on with sixty-three

and, oh, she's dressed in a beautiful dress
it's a dress i do admire
she has pearly blue eyes that open and shut
when worked inside by a wire
and once on a time when the folks had gone
she used to ogle at me
but now that i'm only marked twenty-nine
she turns up her nose at me
she turns up her little snub nose at me
and carries on with sixty-three

i'll see what i can do
you're a fine little fellow, and it's a shame
that she should so treat you
so i took down the label from the shelf above
and i labeled him sixty-three
and i marked the other one twenty-nine
which was _very, very_ wrong of me
but i felt so sorry for that little tin soul
as he rode on his tin gee gee

now that little tin soldier he puffed with pride
at being marked sixty-three
and that saucy little dolly girl smiled once more
for he'd risen in life, do you see
and it's so in this world; for i'm in love
with a maiden of high degree
but i am only marked twenty-nine
and the other chap's sixty-three
and a girl never looks at twenty-nine
with a possible sixty-three



i went into a public-'ouse to get a pint o' beer
the publican 'e up an' sez, "we serve no red-coats here
the girls be'ind the bar they laughed an' giggled fit to die
o it's tommy this, an' tommy that, an' "tommy go away
but it's "thank you, mister atkins," when the band begins to play
the band begins to play, my boys, the band begins to play
o it's "thank you, mister atkins," when the band begins to play

i went into a theater as sober as could be
they give a drunk civilian room, but 'adn't none for me
they sent me to the gallery or round the music-'alls
but when it comes to fightin', lord! they'll shove me in the stalls
for it's tommy this, an' tommy that, an' "tommy wait outside
but it's "special train for atkins," when the trooper's on the tide
the troopship's on the tide, my boys, etc

o makin' mock o' uniforms that guard you while you sleep
is cheaper than them uniforms, an' they're starvation cheap
an' hustlin' drunken sodgers when they're goin' large a bit
is five times better business than paradin' in full kit
then it's tommy this, an' tommy that, an' "tommy, 'ow's yer soul
but it's "thin red line of 'eroes" when the drums begin to roll
the drums begin to roll, my boys, etc

we aren't no thin red 'eroes, nor we aren't no blackguards too
but single men in barricks, most remarkable like you
an' if sometimes our conduck isn't all your fancy paints
why, single men in barricks don't grow into plaster saints
while it's tommy this, an' tommy that, an' "tommy fall be'ind
but it's "please to walk in front, sir," when there's trouble in the wind
there's trouble in the wind, my boys, etc

you talk o' better food for us, an' schools, an' fires, an' all
we'll wait for extry rations if you treat us rational
don't mess about the cook-room slops, but prove it to our face
the widow's uniform[1] is not the soldierman's disgrace
for it's tommy this, an' tommy that, an' "chuck him out, the brute
but it's "saviour of 'is country" when the guns begin to shoot
an' it's tommy this, an' tommy that, an' anything you please
an' tommy ain't a bloomin' fool--you bet that tommy sees

the weaver at his loom is sitting
throws his shuttle to and fro
foot and treadle
hand and pedal
upward, downward, hither, thither
how the weaver makes them go
as the weaver wills they go
up and down the web is plying
and across the woof is flying
what a rattling
what a battling
what a shuffling
what a scuffling
as the weaver makes his shuttle
hither, thither, scud and scuttle
threads in single, threads in double
how they mingle, what a trouble
every color, what profusion
every motion, what confusion
while the web and woof are mingling
signal bells above are jingling
telling how each figure ranges
telling when the color changes
as the weaver makes his shuttle
hither, thither, scud and scuttle

the weaver at his loom is sitting
throws his shuttle to and fro
well the weaver seems to know
as he makes his shuttle go
what each motion
and commotion
what each fusion
and confusion
in the grand result will show
weaving daily
singing gaily
as he makes his busy shuttle
hither, thither, scud and scuttle

the weaver at his loom is sitting
throws his shuttle to and fro
see you not how shape and order
from the wild confusion grow
as he makes his shuttle go
as the web and woof diminish
grows beyond the beauteous finish
tufted plaidings
shapes, and shadings
all the mystery
now is history
and we see the reason subtle
why the weaver makes his shuttle
hither, thither, scud and scuttle

see the mystic weaver sitting
high in heaven--his loom below
up and down the treadles go
takes for web the world's long ages
takes for woof its kings and sages
takes the nobles and their pages
takes all stations and all stages
thrones are bobbins in his shuttle
armies make them scud and scuttle
web into the woof must flow
up and down the nations go
as the weaver wills they go
men are sparring
powers are jarring
upward, downward, hither, thither
just like puppets in a show
up and down the web is plying
and across the woof is flying
what a battling
what a rattling
what a shuffling
what a scuffling
as the weaver makes his shuttle
hither, thither, scud and scuttle

calmly see the mystic weaver
throw his shuttle to and fro
well the weaver seems to know
what each motion
and commotion
what each fusion
and confusion
in the grand result will show
as the nations
kings and stations
upward, downward, hither, thither
as in mystic dances, go
in the present all is mystery
in the past, 'tis beauteous history
o'er the mixing and the mingling
how the signal bells are jingling
see you not the weaver leaving
finished work behind, in weaving
see you not the reason subtle
as the web and woof diminish
changing into beauteous finish
hither, thither, scud and scuttle

glorious wonder! what a weaving
to the dull beyond believing
such, no fabled ages know
only _faith_ can see the mystery
how, along the aisle of history
where the feet of sages go
loveliest to the purest eyes
grand the mystic tapet lies
soft and smooth, and even spreading
every figure has its plaidings
as if made for angels' treading
tufted circles touching ever
inwrought figures fading never
brighter form and softer shadings
each illumined,--what a riddle
from a cross that gems the middle

that its light is all reflected
that the tapet's hues are given
by a sun that shines in heaven
that great god himself is weaving
bringing out the world's dark mystery
in the light of truth and history
and as web and woof diminish
comes the grand and glorious finish
when begin the golden ages
long foretold by seers and sages


and when the world was light and gay, i could not even smile
it stood before me like a giant, outstretched its iron arm
no matter where i looked, i saw the mortgage on the farm

i'll tell you how it happened, for i want the world to know
how glad i am this winter day whilst earth is white with snow
i'm just as happy as a lark. no cause for rude alarm
confronts us now, for lifted is the mortgage on the farm

the children they were growing up and they were smart and trim
to some big college in the east we'd sent our youngest, jim
and every time he wrote us, at the bottom of his screed
he tacked some latin fol-de-rol which none of us could read

the girls they ran to music, and to painting, and to rhymes
they said the house was out of style and far behind the times
they suddenly diskivered that it didn't keep'm warm
another step of course towards a mortgage on the farm

we took a cranky notion, hannah jane and me one day
while we were coming home from town, a-talking all the way
the old house wasn't big enough for us, although for years
beneath its humble roof we'd shared each other's joys and tears

we built it o'er and when 'twas done, i wish you could have seen it
it was a most tremendous thing--i really didn't mean it
why, it was big enough to hold the people of the town
and not one half as cosy as the old one we pulled down

i bought a fine pianner and it shortened still the pile
but, then, it pleased the children and they banged it all the while
no matter what they played for me, their music had no charm
for every tune said plainly: "there's a mortgage on the farm

i worked from morn till eve, and toiled as often toils the slave
to meet that grisly interest; i tried hard to be brave
and oft when i came home at night with tired brain and arm
the chickens hung their heads, they felt the mortgage on the farm

but we saved a penny now and then, we laid them in a row
the girls they played the same old tunes, and let the new ones go
and when from college came our jim with laurels on his brow
i led him to the stumpy field and put him to the plow

he something said in latin which i didn't understand
but it did me good to see his plow turn up the dewy land
and when the year had ended and empty were the cribs
we found we'd hit the mortgage, sir, a blow between the ribs

to-day i harnessed up the team and thundered off to town
and in the lawyer's sight i planked the last bright dollar down
and when i trotted up the lanes a-feeling good and warm
the old red rooster crowed his best: "no mortgage on the farm

i'll sleep almighty good to-night, the best for many a day
the skeleton that haunted us has passed fore'er away
the girls can play the brand-new tunes with no fears to alarm
and jim can go to congress, with no mortgage on the farm


that is what the vision said

in his chamber all alone
kneeling on the floor of stone
prayed the monk in deep contrition
for his sins of indecision
prayed for greater self-denial
in temptation and in trial
it was noonday by the dial
and the monk was all alone

suddenly, as if it lightened
an unwonted splendor brightened
all within him and without him
in that narrow cell of stone
and he saw the blessed vision
of our lord, with light elysian
like a vesture wrapped about him
like a garment round him thrown

not as crucified and slain
not in agonies of pain
not with bleeding hands and feet
did the monk his master see
but as in the village street
in the house or harvest field
halt and lame and blind he healed
when he walked in galilee

in as attitude imploring
hands upon his bosom crossed
wondering, worshiping, adoring
knelt the monk, in rapture lost
lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest
who am i that thus thou deignest
to reveal thyself to me
who am i, that from the center
of thy glory thou shouldst enter
this poor cell, my guest to be

then amid his exaltation
loud the convent bell appalling
from its belfrey calling, calling
rang through court and corridor
with persistent iteration
he had never heard before
it was now the appointed hour
when alike in shine or shower
winter's cold or summer's heat
to the convent portals came
all the blind and halt and lame
all the beggars of the street
for their daily dole of food
dealt them by the brotherhood

and their almoner was he
who upon his bended knees
rapt in silent ecstasy
of divinest self-surrender
saw the vision and the splendor

deep distress and hesitation
mingled with his adoration
should he go, or should he stay
should he leave the poor to wait
hungry at the convent gate
till the vision passed away
should he slight his radiant guest
slight this visitant celestial
for a crowd of ragged, bestial
beggars at the convent gate
would the vision there remain
would the vision come again
then a voice within his breast
whispered audible and clear
as if to the outward ear
leave unto thy lord the rest

straightway to his feet he started
and with longing look intent
on the blessed vision bent
slowly from his cell departed
slowly on his errand went

at the gate the poor were waiting
looking through the iron grating
with that terror in the eye
that is only seen in those
who amid their wants and woes
hear the sound of doors that close
and of feet that pass them by
grown familiar with disfavor
grown familiar with the savor
of the bread by which men die
but to-day, they knew not why
like the gate of paradise
seemed the convent gate to rise
like a sacrament divine
seemed to them the bread and wine
in his heart the monk was praying
thinking of the homeless poor
what they suffer and endure
what we see not, what we see
and the inward voice was saying
to the least of mine and lowest
that thou doest unto me

unto me! but had the vision
come to him in beggar's clothing
come a mendicant imploring
would he then have knelt adoring
or have listened with derision
and have turned away with loathing

thus his conscience put the question
full of troublesome suggestion
as at length, with hurried pace
toward his cell he turned his face
and beheld the convent bright
with a supernatural light
like a luminous cloud expanding
over floor and wall and ceiling

but he paused with awe-struck feeling
at the threshold of his door
for the vision still was standing
as he left it there before
when the convent bell appalling
from its belfry calling, calling
summoned him to feed the poor
through the long hour intervening
it had waited his return
and he felt his bosom burn
comprehending all the meaning
when the blessed vision said



into a ward of the whitewashed halls
where the dead and dying lay
wounded by bayonets, shells, and balls
somebody's darling was borne one day

somebody's darling, so young and so brave
wearing yet on his pale, sweet face
soon to be hid by the dust of the grave
the lingering light of his boyhood's grace

matted and damp are the curls of gold
kissing the snow of the fair young brow
pale are the lips of delicate mold
somebody's darling is dying now

back from his beautiful blue-veined brow
brush all the wandering waves of gold
cross his hands on his bosom now
somebody's darling is still and cold

kiss him once for somebody's sake
murmur a prayer both soft and low
one bright curl from its fair mates take
they were somebody's pride, you know

somebody's hand hath rested there
was it a mother's, soft and white
and have the lips of a sister fair
been baptized in their waves of light

god knows best! he was somebody's love
somebody's heart enshrined him there
somebody wafted his name above
night and morn on the wings of prayer

somebody wept when he marched away
looking so handsome, brave, and grand
somebody's kiss on his forehead lay
somebody clung to his parting hand

somebody's waiting and watching for him
yearning to hold him again to her heart
and there he lies with his blue eyes dim
and the smiling, child-like lips apart

tenderly bury the fair young dead
pausing to drop on his grave a tear
carve in the wooden slab at his head



south mountain towered upon our right, far off the river lay
and over on the wooded height we held their lines at bay
at last the muttering guns were still; the day died slow and wan
at last the gunners pipes did fill, the sergeant's yarns began
when, as the wind a moment blew aside the fragrant flood
our brierwoods raised, within our view a little maiden stood
a tiny tot of six or seven, from fireside fresh she seemed
and as we stared, her little hand went to her curly head
in grave salute. "and who are _you_?" at length the sergeant said
my home? why, that was burned away, and pa and ma are dead
and so i ride the guns all day along with sergeant ned
and i've a drum that's not a toy, a cap with feathers, too
and i march beside the drummer boy on sundays at review
but now our 'bacca's all give out, the men can't have their smoke
and so they're cross--why, even ned won't play with me and joke
and the big colonel said to-day--i hate to hear him swear
he'd give a leg for a good pipe like the yanks had over there
and so i thought when beat the drum,  and the big guns were still
i'd creep beneath the tent and come out here across the hill
and beg, good mister yankee men, you'd give me some 'lone jack
please do: when we get some again, i'll surely bring it back
indeed i will, for ned--says he,--if i do what i say
i'll be a general yet, maybe, and ride a prancing bay

we brimmed her tiny apron o'er; you should have heard her laugh
as each man from his scanty store shook out a generous half
to kiss the little mouth stooped down a score of grimy men
until the sergeant's husky voice said,"'tention squad!" and then
we gave her escort, till good-night the pretty waif we bid
and watched her toddle out of sight--or else 'twas tears that hid
her tiny form--nor turned about a man, nor spoke a word
till after awhile a far, hoarse shout upon the wind we heard
we sent it back, then cast sad eyes upon the scene around
a baby's hand had touched the ties that brothers once had bound

that's all--save when the dawn awoke again the work of hell
and through the sullen clouds of smoke the screaming missiles fell
our general often rubbed his glass, and marveled much to see



it was kept out in the kitchen, and 'twas long and deep and wide
and the poker hung above it and the shovel stood beside
and the big, black cookstove, grinnin' through its grate from ear to ear
seemed to look as if it loved it like a brother, pretty near
flowered oilcloth tacked around it kept its cracks and knot-holes hid
and a pair of leather hinges fastened on the heavy lid
and it hadn't any bottom--or, at least, it seemed that way
when you hurried in to fill it, so's to get outside and play

when the noons was hot and lazy and the leaves hung dry and still
and the locust in the pear tree started up his planin'-mill
and the drum-beat of the breakers was a soothin', temptin' roll
and you knew the "gang" was waitin' by the brimmin' "swimmin' hole
louder than the locust's buzzin,' louder than the breakers' roar
you could hear the wood-box holler, "come and fill me up once more
and the old clock ticked and chuckled as you let each armful drop
like it said, "another minute, and you're nowheres near the top

in the chilly winter mornin's when the bed was snug and warm
and the frosted winders tinkled 'neath the fingers of the storm
and your breath rose off the piller in a smoky cloud of steam
then that wood-box, grim and empty, came a-dancin' through your dream
came and pounded at your conscience, screamed in aggravatin' glee
land! how plain it is this minute--shed and barn and drifted snow
and the slabs of oak a-waitin!, piled and ready, in a row

never was a fishin' frolic, never was a game of ball
but that mean, provokin' wood-box had to come and spoil it all
you might study at your lessons and 'twas full and full to stay
but jest start an injun story, and 'twas empty right away
seemed as if a spite was in it, and although i might forgit
all the other chores that plagued me, i can hate that wood-box yit
and when i look back at boyhood--shakin' off the cares of men
still it comes to spoil the picture, screamin', "fill me up again



good deacon roland--"may his tribe increase
awoke one sabbath morn feeling at peace
with god and all mankind. his wants supplied
he read his bible and then knelt beside
the family altar, and uplifted there
his voice to god in fervent praise and prayer
in praise for blessings past, so rich and free
and prayer for benedictions yet to be
then on a stile, which spanned the dooryard fence
he sat him down complacently, and thence
surveyed with pride, o'er the far-reaching plain
his flocks and herds and fields of golden grain
his meadows waving like the billowy seas
and orchards filled with over-laden trees
quoth he: "how vast the products of my lands
abundance crowns the labor of my hands
great is my substance; god indeed is good
who doth in love provide my daily food

while thus he sat in calm soliloquy
a voice aroused him from his reverie
a childish voice from one whose shoeless feet
brought him unnoticed to the deacon's seat
if i had money i would gladly pay
for bread; but i am poor, and cannot buy
should ask for something, just for what you call
cold pieces from your table, that is all
the deacon listened to the child's request
the while his penetrating eye did rest
on him whose tatters, trembling, quick revealed
the agitation of the heart concealed
within the breast of one unskilled in ruse
who asked not alms like one demanding dues
then said the deacon: "i am not inclined
to give encouragement to those who find
it easier to beg for bread betimes
than to expend their strength in earning dimes
wherewith to purchase it. a parent ought
to furnish food for those whom he has brought
into this world, where each one has his share
of tribulation, sorrow, toil and care
i sympathize with you, my little lad
your destitution makes me feel so sad
but, for the sake of those who should supply
your wants, i must your earnest plea deny
and inasmuch as giving food to you
would be providing for your parents, too
thus fostering vagrancy and idleness
i cannot think such charity would bless
who gives or takes; and therefore i repeat
i cannot give you anything to eat
before this "vasty deep" of logic stood
the child nor found it satisfying food
nor did he tell the tale he might have told
of parents slumbering in the grave's damp mould
but quickly shrank away to find relief
in giving vent to his rekindled grief
while deacon roland soon forgot the appeal
in meditating on his better weal

ere long the sabbath bells their peals rang out
to summon worshippers, with hearts devout
to wait on god and listen to his word
and then the deacon's pious heart was stirred
and in the house of god he soon was found
engaged in acts of worship most profound
wearied, however, with his week-day care
he fell asleep before the parson's prayer
was ended; then he dreamed he died and came
to heaven's grand portal, and announced his name
to join the saints; please set the gates ajar
that i may 'join the everlasting song
and mingle ever with the ransomed throng
then lo! "a horror of great darkness" came
upon him, as he heard a voice exclaim
i never knew you, for indeed, howe'er
you may have wrought on earth, the sad, sad fact
remains, that life's sublimest, worthiest act
the deacon woke to find it all a dream
just as the minister announced his theme
as practice charity; for 'inasmuch
as ye have done it to the least of these
my little ones' saith he who holds the keys
of heaven, 'ye have done it unto me
and i will give you immortality

straightway the deacon left his cushioned pew
and from the church in sudden haste withdrew
and up the highway ran, on love's swift feet
to overtake the child of woe, and greet
him as the worthy representative
of christ the lord and to him freely give
all needful good, that thus he might atone
for the neglect which he before had shown
thus journeying, god directed all his way
o'er hill and dale, to where the outcast lay
beside the road bemoaning his sad fate
and then the deacon said, "my child, 'tis late
make haste and journey with me to my home
to guide you thither, i myself have come
and you shall have the food you asked in vain
for god himself hath made my duty plain
if he demand it, all i have is thine
shrink not, but trust me; place thy hand in mine
and as they journeyed toward the deacon's home
the child related how he came to roam
until the listening deacon understood
the touching story of his orphanhood
then, finding in the little waif a gem
worthy to deck the saviour's diadem
he drew him to his loving breast, and said
nor shall you go from hence again to roam
while god in love provides for us a home
and as the weeks and months roll on apace
the deacon held the lad in love's embrace
and being childless did on him confer
the boon of sonship

thus the almoner
of god's great bounty to the destitute
the deacon came to be; and as the fruit
of having learned to keep the golden rule
his charity became all-bountiful
and from thenceforth he lived to benefit
mankind; and when in life's great book were writ
their names who heeded charity's request
lo! deacon roland's "name led all the rest



talking of sects quite late one eve
what one and another of saints believe
that night i stood in a troubled dream
by the side of a darkly-flowing stream

and a "churchman" down to the river came
when i heard a strange voice call his name
you must leave your robes on the other side

but the aged father did not mind
and his long gown floated out behind
as down to the stream his way he took
his hands firm hold of a gilt-edged book

i shall want my book of common prayer
and though i put on a starry crown
i should feel quite lost without my gown

then he fixed his eye on the shining track
but his gown was heavy and held him back
and the poor old father tried in vain
a single step in the flood to gain

i saw him again on the other side
but his silk gown floated on the tide
and no one asked, in that blissful spot
if he belonged to "the church" or not

then down to the river a quaker strayed
his dress of a sober hue was made
i cannot go any other way

then he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin
and staidly, solemnly, waded in
and his broad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight
over his forehead, so cold and white

but a strong wind carried away his hat
and he sighed a few moments over that
and then, as he gazed to the farther shore
the coat slipped off and was seen no more

poor, dying quaker, thy suit of gray
is quietly sailing--away--away
but thou'lt go to heaven, as straight as an arrow
whether thy brim be broad or narrow

next came dr. watts with a bundle of psalms
tied nicely up in his aged arms
and hymns as many, a very wise thing
that the people in heaven, "all round," might sing

but i thought that he heaved an anxious sigh
as he saw that the river ran broad and high
and looked rather surprised, as one by one
the psalms and hymns in the wave went down

came wesley, the pattern of godliness
but he cried, "dear me, what shall i do
the water has soaked them through and through

and there, on the river, far and wide
away they went on the swollen tide
and the saint, astonished, passed through alone
without his manuscripts, up to the throne

then gravely walking, two saints by name
down to the stream together came
but as they stopped at the river's brink
i saw one saint from the other shrink

how you attained to life's great end

as i'm 'close communion,' to cross with you
you're bound, i know, to the realms of bliss
but you must go that way, and i'll go this

and straightway plunging with all his might
away to the left--his friend at the right
apart they went from this world of sin
but how did the brethren "enter in

and now where the river was rolling on
a presbyterian church went down
of women, there seemed an innumerable throng
but the men i could count as they passed along

and concerning the road they could never agree
the _old_ or the _new_ way, which it could be
nor ever a moment paused to think
that both would lead to the river's brink

and a sound of murmuring long and loud
came ever up from the moving crowd
that is the false, and this is the true
or, "i'm in the old way, and you're in the new

but the brethren only seemed to speak
modest the sisters walked, and meek
and if ever one of them chanced to say
what troubles she met with on the way
how she longed to pass to the other side
nor feared to cross over the swelling tide
a voice arose from the brethren then
for have ye not heard the words of paul

i watched them long in my curious dream
till they stood by the border of the stream
then, just as i thought, the two ways met
but all the brethren were talking yet
and would talk on, till the heaving tide
carried them over, side by side
side by side, for the way was one
the toilsome journey of life was done
and priest and quaker, and all who died
came out alike on the other side
no forms or crosses, or books had they
no gowns of silk, or suits of gray
for all had put on "christ's righteousness



i can't tell much about the thing, 'twas done so powerful quick
but 'pears to me i got a most outlandish heavy lick
it broke my leg, and tore my skulp, and jerked my arm 'most out
but take a seat: i'll try and tell jest how it kem about

you see, i'd started down to town, with that 'ere team of mine
a-haulin' down a load o' corn to ebenezer kline
and drivin' slow; for, jest about a day or two before
the off-horse run a splinter in his foot, and made it sore

you know the railroad cuts across the road at martin's hole
well, thar i seed a great big sign, raised high upon a pole
i thought i'd stop and read the thing, and find out what it said
and so i stopped the hosses on the railroad-track, and read

i ain't no scholar, rekollect, and so i had to spell
and that spelt "rail" as clear as mud; r-o-a-d was "road
i lumped 'em: "railroad" was the word, and that 'ere much i knowed

c-r-o and double s, with i-n-g to boot
made "crossing" jest as plain as noah webster dared to do't
and i wos lookin' all the time, and spellin' like a book

o-u-t spelt "out" just right; and there it was, "look out
i's kinder cur'us like, to know jest what't was all about
f-o-r and t-h-e; 'twas then "look out for the

i'd got that fur, when suddintly there came an awful whack
a thousand fiery thunderbolts just scooped me off the track
the hosses went to davy jones, the wagon went to smash
and i was histed seven yards above the tallest ash

i didn't come to life ag'in fur 'bout a day or two
but, though i'm crippled up a heap, i sorter struggled through
it ain't the pain, nor 'taint the loss o' that 'ere team of mine
but, stranger, how i'd like to know the rest of that 'ere sign




turn back the leaves of history. on yon pacific shore
a world-known city's fall and rise shall thrill your hearts once more
effulgent in the splendor of the dying orb of day
that bathed in flood of crimson light mount tamalpais' lonely height
and kissed the sister towns "goodnight" across the misty bay

it burst in glory on the hills, lit up the princely homes
and gleamed from lofty towers and spires and flashed from gilded domes
it glorified the massive blocks caught in its widening flow
engulfed the maze of streets and parks that stretched away below
till marble white and foliage green and vales of gray, and silvery sheen
of ocean's surface vast, serene, were tinted by its glow

the tranquil murmurs of the deep were borne on balmy air
all odorous with lily breath and roses sweet and rare
the zephyrs sang a lullaby as the slow, fiery ball
ended its trail of gorgeousness behind horizon's wall
then gray absorbed each rainbow hue and dark the beauteous landscape grew
as shadowy evening softly drew her curtain over all


that night around the festal board, 'mid incandescence gay
sat pomp and pride and wealth and power, in sumptuous array
that night the happy, careless throng were all on pleasure bent
and beauty in her jewelled robes to ball and opera went
the sunset city sank to rest in peace, secure, content


unconscious of approaching doom, old san francisco sleeps
while from the east, all smilingly, the april morning creeps
see! playful sunbeams tinge with gold the mountains in the sky
and hazy clouds of gray unfold--but, hark! what means that cry
the ground vibrates with sadden shock. the buildings tremble, groan
and rock
wild fears the waking senses mock, and some wake but to die

a frightful subterranean force the earth's foundation shakes
the city quivers in the throes of fierce, successive quakes
and massive structures thrill like giant oaks before the blast
into the streets with deafening crash the frailer ones are cast
half garbed, the multitude rush out in frantic haste, with prayer and
shout
to join the panic stricken rout. ho! death is marching past

a rumbling noise! the streets upheave, and sink again, like waves
and shattered piles and shapeless wrecks are strewn with human graves
danger at every corner lurks. destruction fills the air
death-laden showers of mortar, bricks, are falling everywhere


to their hearts
are struggling for the open parts in frenzy of despair

a hundred tiny tongues of flame forth from the ruins burst
no water! god! what shall we do to slake their quenchless thirst
the shocks have broken all the mains! "_use wine!_" the people cry
the red flames laugh like drunken fiends; they stagger as to die
then up again in fury spring, on high their crimson draperies fling
from block to block they leap and swing, and smoke clouds hide the sky

ha! from the famed presidio that guards the golden gate
come funston and his regulars to match their strength with fate
the soldiers and the citizens are fighting side by side
to check that onslaught of red wrath, to stem destruction's tide
with roar, and boom, and blare, and blast, an open space is cleared at
the fiends of fury gallop past with flanks outstretched and wide

around the city's storehouses they wreathe and twine and dance
and wealth and splendor shrivel up before their swift advance
before their devastating breath the stricken people flee
into that vortex of red hell sink church and theatre, store, hotel
with thunderous roar and hissing yell on sweeps the crimson sea

again with charge of dynamite the lurid clouds are riven
again with heat and sulphur smoke the troops are backward driven
all day, all night, all day again, with that infernal host
they strive in vain for mastery. each vantage gained is lost
on comes the bellowing flood of flame in furious wrath its own to claim
resistless in its awful aim each space is bridged and crossed

ah god! the miles and miles of waste! one half the city gone
and westward now--toward van ness--the roaring flames roll on
and there, at broad van ness, the troops make their heroic stand
the fight is now for life--sweet life, for helpless babe and homeless
the culmination of the strife spectacularly grand

on sweeps the hurricane of fire. the fatal touch is given
the detonation of the blast goes shrieking up to heaven
the mansions of bonanza kings are tottering to their doom
that swirling tide of fiery fate halts at the gaping tomb
beyond the cataclysm's brink, the multitude, too dazed to think
behold the red waves rise and--sink into the smoldering gloom


the fire has swept the waterfront and burned the mission down
the business section--swallowed up, and wiped out chinatown
full thirty thousand homes destroyed, nob hill in ashes lies
and ghastly skeletons of steel on market street arise
a gruesome picture everywhere! 'tis desolation grim and bare
waits artisan and millionaire beneath rank sulphurous skies

to-night, within the city parks, famished, benumbed and mute
two hundred thousand refugees, homeless and destitute
upon the hard, cold ground they crouch--the wrecks of pomp and pride
milady and the city waifs are huddled side by side
and there, 'neath shelter rude and frail, we hear the new-born infants
while' nations read the tragic tale--how san francisco died


prophecy--1906

not dead! though maimed, her soul yet lives--indomitable will
the faith, the hope, the spirit bold nor quake nor fire can kill
to-morrow hearts shall throb again with western enterprise
and from the ruins of to-day a city shall arise
a monument of beauty great reared by the conquerors of fate
the city of the golden gate and matchless sunset skies


fulfillment--1915

reborn, rebuilt, she rose again, far vaster in expanse
a radiant city smiling from the ashes of romance
a san francisco glorified, more beauteous than of yore
enthroned upon her splendid hills, queen of the sunset shore
her flags of industry unfurled, her portals open to the world
thus, in the book of destiny, she lives for evermore




the autumn is old
the sere leaves are flying
he hath gathered up gold
and now he is dying
old age, begin sighing

the vintage is ripe
the harvest is heaping
but some that have sowed
have no riches for reaping
poor wretch, fall a-weeping

the year's in the wane
there is nothing adorning
the night has no eve
and the day has no morning
cold winter gives warning

the rivers run chill
the red sun is sinking
and i am grown old
and life is fast shrinking
here's enow for sad thinking



why, yes, dear, we can put it by. it does seem out of place
on top of these down comforts and this spread of silk and lace
you see, i'm used to having it lie so, across my feet
but maybe i won't need it here, with this nice furnace heat
i made it? yes, dear, long ago. 'twas lots of work, you think
oh, not so much. my rose quilt, now, all white and green and pink
is really handsome. this is just a plain, log cabin block
pieced out of odds and ends; but still--now that's your papa's frock
before he walked, and this bit here is his first little suit
i trimmed it up with silver braid. my, but he did look cute
that red there in the centers, was your aunt ruth's for her name
her grandmother almost clothed the child, before the others came
those plaids? the younger girls', they were. i dressed them just alike
and this was baby winnie's sack--the precious little tyke
ma wore this gown to visit me (they drove the whole way then
and little edson wore this waist. he never came again
this lavender par'matta was your great-aunt jane's--poor dear
mine was a sprig, with the lilac ground; see, in the corner here
such goods were high in war times. ah, that scrap of army blue
your bright eyes spied it! yes, dear child, that has its memories, too
they sent him home on furlough once--our soldier brother ned
but somewhere, now, the dear boy sleeps among the unknown dead
that flowered patch? well, now, to think you'd pick that from the rest
why, dearie--yes, it's satin ribbed--that's grandpa's wedding vest
just odds and ends! no great for looks. my rose quilt's nicer, far
or the one in basket pattern, or the double-pointed star
but, somehow--what! we'll leave it here? the bed won't look so neat
but i think i would sleep better with it so, across my feet


two angels, one of life and one of death
passed o'er our village as the morning broke
the dawn was on their faces, and beneath
the sombre houses hearsed with plumes of smoke

their attitude and aspect were the same
alike their features and their robes of white
but one was crowned with amaranth, as with flame
and one with asphodels, like flakes of light

i saw them pause on their celestial way
then said i, with deep fear and doubt oppressed
the place where thy beloved are at rest

and he who wore the crown of asphodels
descending, at my door began to knock
and my soul sank within me, as in wells
the waters sink before an earthquake's shock

i recognized the nameless agony
the terror and the tremor and the pain
that oft before had filled or haunted me
and now returned with threefold strength again

the door i opened to my heavenly guest
and listened, for i thought i heard god's voice
and, knowing whatsoe'er he sent was best
dared neither to lament nor to rejoice

then with a smile, that filled the house with light
and ere i answered, passing out of sight
on his celestial embassy he sped

the angel with the amaranthine wreath
pausing, descended, and with, voice divine
whispered a word that had a sound like death

then fell upon the house a sudden gloom
a shadow on those features fair and thin
and softly, from that hushed and darkened room
two angels issued, where but one went in

all is of god! if he but waves his hand
the mists collect, the rain falls thick and loud
till, with a smile of light on sea and land
lo! he looks back from the departing cloud

angels of life and death alike are his
without his leave they pass no threshold o'er
who, then, would wish or dare, believing this
against his messengers to shut the door



it was the pleasant harvest-time
when cellar-bins are closely stowed
and garrets bend beneath their load
and the old swallow-haunted barns
brown-gabled, long, and full of seams
through which the moted sunlight streams

and winds blow freshly in, to shake
the red plumes of the roosted cocks
and the loose hay-mow's scented locks
are filled with summer's ripened stores
its odorous grass and barley sheaves
from their low scaffolds to their eaves

on esek harden's oaken floor
with many an autumn threshing worn
lay the heaped ears of unhusked corn
and thither came young men and maids
beneath a moon that, large and low
lit that sweet eve of long ago
they took their places; some by chance
and others by a merry voice
or sweet smile guided to their choice

how pleasantly the rising moon
between the shadow of the mows
looked on them through the great elm-boughs
on sturdy boyhood, sun-embrowned
on girlhood with its solid curves
of healthful strength and painless nerves
and jests went round, and laughs that made
the house-dog answer with his howl
and kept astir the barn-yard fowl

and quaint old songs their fathers sung
in derby dales and yorkshire moors
ere norman william trod their shores
and tales, whose merry license shook
the fat sides of the saxon thane
forgetful of the hovering dane

but still the sweetest voice was mute
that river-valley ever heard
from lip of maid or throat of bird
for mabel martin sat apart
and let the hay-mow's shadow 'fall
upon the loveliest face of all
she sat apart, as one forbid
who knew that none would condescend
to own the witch-wife's child a friend

the seasons scarce had gone their round
since curious thousands thronged to see
her mother on the gallows-tree
and mocked the palsied limbs of age
that faltered on the fatal stairs
and wan lip trembling with its prayers

few questioned of the sorrowing child
or, when they saw the mother die
dreamed of the daughter's agony
they went up to their homes that day
as men and christians justified
god willed it, and the wretch had died

dear god and father of us all
forgive our faith in cruel lies
forgive the blindness that denies
forgive thy creature when he takes
for the all-perfect love thou art
some grim creation of his heart
cast down our idols, overturn
our bloody altars; let us see
thyself in thy humanity

poor mabel from her mother's grave
crept to her desolate hearth-stone
and wrestled with her fate alone
with love, and anger, and despair
the phantoms of disordered sense
the awful doubts of providence
the school-boys jeered her as they passed
and, when she sought the house of prayer
her mother's curse pursued her there
and still o'er many a neighboring door
she saw the horseshoe's curved charm
to guard against her mother's harm

that mother, poor, and sick, and lame
who daily, by the old arm-chair
folded her withered hands in prayer
who turned, in salem's dreary jail
her worn old bible o'er and o'er
when her dim eyes could read no more

sore tried and pained, the poor girl kept
her faith, and trusted that her way
so dark, would somewhere meet the day
and still her weary wheel went round
day after day, with no relief
small leisure have the poor for grief

so in the shadow mabel sits
untouched by mirth she sees and hears
her smile is sadder than her tears
but cruel eyes have found her out
and cruel lips repeat her name
and taunt her with her mother's shame

she answered not with railing words
but drew her apron o'er her face
and, sobbing, glided from the place
and only pausing at the door
her sad eyes met the troubled gaze
of one who, in her better days
had been her warm and steady friend
ere yet her mother's doom had made
even esek harden half afraid

he felt that mute appeal of tears
and, starting, with an angry frown
hushed all the wicked murmurs down
i brook no insult to my guest

but god's sweet pity ministers
unto no whiter soul than hers
let goody martin rest in peace
i never knew her harm a fly
i know who swore her life away
and, as god lives, i'd not condemn
an indian dog on word of them

poor mabel, in her lonely home
sat by the window's narrow pane
white in the moonlight's silver rain
the river, on its pebbled rim
made music such as childhood knew
the door-yard tree was whispered through
by voices such as childhood's ear
had heard in moonlights long ago
and through the willow boughs below
she saw the rippled waters shine
beyond, in waves of shade and light
the hills rolled off into the night

sweet sounds and pictures mocking so
the sadness of her human lot
she saw and heard, but heeded not
she strove to drown her sense of wrong
and, in her old and simple way
to teach, her bitter heart to pray

poor child! the prayer, began in faith
grew to a low, despairing cry
of utter misery: "let me die
oh! take me from the scornful eyes
and hide me where the cruel speech
and mocking finger may not reach

a daughter's right i dare not crave
to weep above her unblest grave
let me not live until my heart
with few to pity, and with none
to love me, hardens into stone
o god! have mercy on thy child
whose faith in thee grows weak and small
and take me ere i lose it all

the broadest lands in all the town
the skill to guide, the power to awe
were harden's; and his word was law
none dared withstand him to his face
but one sly maiden spake aside
her mother only killed a cow
or witched a churn or dairy-pan
but she, forsooth, must charm a man

a shadow on the moonlight fell
and murmuring wind and wave became
a voice whose burden was her name
had then god heard her? had he sent
his angel down? in flesh and blood
before her esek harden stood

he laid his hand upon her arm
who scoffs at you, must scoff at me
you know rough esek harden well
and if he seems no suitor gay
and if his hair is mixed with gray
the maiden grown shall never find
his heart less warm than when she smiled
upon his knees, a little child

her tears of grief were tears of joy
as folded in his strong embrace
she looked in esek harden's face
and make me worthy of my lot

he led her through his dewy fields
to where the swinging lanterns glowed
and through the doors the huskers showed
in mabel see my chosen wife

the past is past, and all offence
falls harmless from her innocence
henceforth she stands no more alone
you know what esek harden is
he brooks no wrong to him or his

now let the merriest tales be told
and let the sweetest songs be sung
that ever made the old heart young
for now the lost has found a home
and a lone hearth shall brighter burn
as all the household joys return

oh, pleasantly the harvest moon
between the shadow of the mows
looked on them through the great elm-boughs
on mabel's curls of golden hair
on esek's shaggy strength it fell
and the wind whispered, "it is well



king david's limbs were weary. he had fled
from far jerusalem; and now he stood
with his faint people for a little rest
upon the shore of jordan. the light wind
of morn was stirring, and he bared his brow
to its refreshing breath; for he had worn
the mourner's covering, and he had not felt
that he could see his people until now

they gathered round him on the fresh green bank
and spoke their kindly words, and as the sun
rose up in heaven he knelt among them there
and bowed his head upon his hands to pray
oh! when the heart is full--where bitter thoughts
come crowding thickly up for utterance
and the poor common words of courtesy
are such a mockery--how much
the bursting heart may pour itself in prayer
he prayed for israel--and his voice went up
strongly and fervently. he prayed for those
whose love had been his shield--and his deep tones
grew tremulous. but, oh! for absalom
for his estranged, misguided absalom
the proud, bright being who had burst away
in all his princely beauty to defy
the heart that cherished him--for him he prayed
in agony that would not be controll'd
strong supplication, and forgave him there
before his god for his deep sinfulness

the pall was settled. he who slept beneath
was straightened for the grave, and as the folds
sank to their still proportions, they betrayed
the matchless symmetry of absalom
the mighty joab stood beside the bier
and gazed upon the dark pall steadfastly
as if he feared the slumberer might stir
a slow step startled him. he grasped his blade
as if a trumpet rang, but the bent form
of david entered; and he gave command
in a low tone to his few followers
and left him with the dead

the king stood still
till the last echo died; then, throwing off
the sackcloth from his brow, and laying back
the pall from the still features of his child
he bowed his head upon him and broke forth
in the resistless eloquence of woe

thou who were made so beautifully fair
that death should settle in thy glorious eye
and leave his stillness in this clustering hair
how could he mark thee for the silent tomb
my proud boy, absalom

as to my bosom i have tried to press thee
how was i wont to feel my pulses thrill
like a rich harp-string yearning to caress thee
and hear thy sweet 'my father!' from those dumb
and cold lips, absalom

of music, and the voices of the young
and life will pass me in the mantling blush
and the dark tresses to the soft winds flung
but thou no more, with thy sweet voice, shalt come
to meet me, absalom

like a bruised reed, is waiting to be broken
how will its love for thee, as i depart
yearn for thine ear to drink its last deep token
it were so sweet, amid death's gathering gloom
to see thee, absalom

with death so like a gentle slumber on thee
and thy dark sin! oh! i could drink the cup
if from this woe its bitterness had won thee
may god have called thee, like a wanderer, home
my lost boy, absalom

he covered up his face, and bowed himself
a moment on his child; then, giving him
a look of melting tenderness, he clasped
his hands convulsively, as if in prayer
and, as if strength were given him of god
he rose up calmly, and composed the pall
firmly and decently--and left him there
as if his rest had been a breathing sleep



it is christmas day in the workhouse
and the cold bare walls are bright
with garlands of green and holly
and the place is a pleasant sight
for with clean-washed hands and faces
in a long and hungry line
the paupers sit at the tables
for this is the hour they dine

and the guardians and their ladies
although the wind is east
have come in their furs and wrappers
to watch their charges feast
to smile and be condescending
put pudding on pauper plates
to be hosts at the workhouse banquet
they've paid for--with the rates

oh, the paupers are meek and lowly
with their "thank'ee kindly, mum's
so long as they fill their stomachs
what matter whence it comes
but one of the old men mutters
and pushes his plate aside
for this is the day _she_ died

the guardians gazed in horror
the master's face went white
then the ladies clutched their husbands
thinking the man would die
struck by a bolt, or something
by the outraged one on high

but the pauper sat for a moment
then rose 'mid a silence grim
for the others had ceased to chatter
and trembled in every limb
he looked at the guardians' ladies
then, eyeing their lords, he said
whose hands are foul and red

from their dark unhallowed graves
who, torn by the hounds and mangled
declines the vulture's feast

and i won't be dragged away
just let me have the fit out
it's only on christmas day
that the black past comes to goad me
and prey on my burning brain
i'll tell you the rest in a whisper
i swear i won't shout again

hear me right out to the end
you come here to see how paupers
the season of christmas spend
you come here to watch us feeding
as they watch the captured beast
hear why a penniless pauper
spits on your palfry feast

and let you smile and think
you're doing a noble action
with the parish's meat and drink
where is my wife, you traitors
the poor old wife you slew
yes, by the god above us
my nance was killed by you

starved in a filthy den
i had never been to the parish
i came to the parish then
i swallowed my pride in coming
for, ere the ruin came
i held up my head as a trader
and i bore a spotless name

bread for a starving wife
bread for the woman who'd loved me
through fifty years of life
and what do you think they told me
mocking my awful grief
that 'the house' was open to us
but they wouldn't give 'out relief

and the bakers' shops were open
tempting a man to thieve
but i clenched my fists together
holding my head awry
so i came to her empty-handed
and mournfully told her why

she had heard of the ways of _that
for her bloodless cheeks went crimson
and up in her rags she sat
crying, 'bide the christmas here, john
we've never had one apart
i think i can bear the hunger
the other would break my heart

holding her hand in mine
praying the lord, and weeping
till my lips were salt as brine
i asked her once if she hungered
and as she answered 'no
the moon shone in at the window
set in a wreath of snow

and i saw in my darling's eyes
the far-away look of wonder
that comes when the spirit flies
and her lips were parched and parted
and her reason came and went
for she raved of our home in devon
where our happiest years were spent

came back to the tongue once more
for she talked like the country lassie
i woo'd by the devon shore
then she rose to her feet and trembled
and fell on the rags and moaned
and, 'give me a crust--i'm famished
for the love of god!' she groaned

and flew to the workhouse gate
crying 'food for a dying woman
and the answer came, 'too late
they drove me away with curses
then i fought with a dog in the street
and tore from the mongrel's clutches
a crust he was trying to eat

back, through the trampled slush
up to the crazy garret
wrapped in an awful hush
my heart sank down at the threshold
and i paused with a sudden thrill
for there in the silv'ry moonlight
my nance lay, cold and still

the sunken eyes were cast
i knew on those lips all bloodless
my name had been the last
she'd called for her absent husband
o god! had i but known
had called in vain, and in anguish
had died in that den--_alone

lay a loving woman dead
cruelly starved and murdered
for a loaf of the parish bread
at yonder gate, last christmas
i craved for a human life
you, who would feast us paupers

don't mind me in the least
think of the happy paupers
eating your christmas feast
and when you recount their blessings
in your snug, parochial way
say what you did for _me_, too
only last christmas day



first on the list is washington, virginia's proudest name
john adams next, the federalist, from massachusetts came
three sons of old virginia into the white house go

and tennessee a democrat, brave jackson staunch and true
martin van buren of new york, and harrison we see
and tyler of virginia, and polk of tennessee

louisiana taylor sent; new york millard fillmore
new hampshire gave us franklin pierce; when his term was o'er
the keystone state buchanan sent.  war thunders shook the realm
abe lincoln wore a martyr's crown, and johnson took the helm

then u.s. grant of illinois who ruled with sword and pen
and hayes, and garfield who was shot, two noble buckeye men
chester arthur from new york, and grover cleveland came
ben harrison served just four years, then cleveland ruled again

mckinley--shot at buffalo--the nation plunged in grief
and "teddy" roosevelt of new york served seven years as chief
taft of ohio followed him. then woodrow wilson came
new jersey's learned democrat; war set the world aflame

and when the tide of strife and hate its baneful course had run
the country went republican and warren harding won
no duty would he shirk,--he died while on a western trip
coolidge of massachusetts then assumed the leadership



and annie and willie had crept into bed
there were tears on their pillows, and tears in their eyes
and each little bosom was heaving with sighs
for to-night their stern father's command had been given
that they should retire precisely at seven
instead of at eight; for they troubled him more
with questions unheard of than ever before
he had told them he thought this delusion a sin
no such being as santa claus ever had been
and he hoped, after this, he should never more hear
how he scrambled down chimneys with presents, each year
and this was the reason that two little heads
so restlessly tossed on their soft downy beds

eight, nine, and the clock on the steeple tolled ten
not a word had been spoken by either till then
when willie's sad face from the blanket did peep
and whispered, "dear annie, is oo fast asleep
for somehow, it makes me so sorry because
dear papa has said there is no santa claus
now we know there is, and it can't be denied
for he came every year before mamma died
but then i've been thinking that she used to pray
and god would hear everything mamma would say
and perhaps she asked him to send santa claus here
with the sacks full of presents he brought every year
and ask him to send him with presents aden
four little bare feet bounded out on the floor
and four little knees the soft carpet pressed
and two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast
that the presents we ask for we're sure to receive
you must wait just as still till i say the 'amen
and by that you will know that your turn has come then
dear jesus, look down on my brother and me
and grant as the favor we are asking of thee
i want a wax dolly, a tea-set and ring
and an ebony work-box that shuts with a spring
bless papa, dear jesus, and cause him to see
that santa claus loves us far better than he
don't let him get fretful and angry again
at dear brother willie, and annie, amen
and bing us some pesents before it is 'ight
i want he should div me a nice ittle sed
with bight, shiny unners, and all painted yed
a box full of tandy, a book and a toy
amen--and then desus, i'll be a dood boy
their prayers being ended they raised up their heads
and with hearts light and cheerful again sought their beds
they were soon lost in slumber both peaceful and deep
and with fairies in dreamland were roaming in sleep

eight, nine, and the little french clock had struck ten
ere the father had thought of his children again
he seems now to hear annie's half suppressed sighs
and to see the big tears stand in willie's blue eyes
but then i was troubled,--my feelings found vent
for bank-stock to-day has gone down ten per cent
but of course they've forgotten their troubles ere this
and that i denied them the thrice asked-for kiss
but just to make sure i'll steal up to their door
for i never spoke harsh to my darlings before
so saying, he softly ascended the stairs
and arrived at the door to hear both of their prayers
his annie's "bless papa" draws forth the big tears
and willie's grave promise falls sweet on his ears
i'll atone for my harshness," he inwardly said

then he turned to the stairs, and softly went down
threw off velvet slippers and silk dressing-gown
donned hat, coat, and boots, and was out in the street
a millionaire facing the cold driving sleet
nor stopped he until he had bought everything
from the box full of candy to the tiny gold ring
indeed he kept adding so much to his store
that the various presents outnumbered a score
then homeward he turned with his holiday load
and with aunt mary's aid in the nursery 'twas stowed
miss dolly was seated beneath a pine-tree
by the side of a table spread out for a tea
a work-box well filled in the centre was laid
and on it the ring for which annie had prayed
a soldier in uniform stood by a sled
with bright shining runners, and all painted red
there were balls, dogs and horses, books pleasing to see
and birds of all colors--were perched in the tree
while santa claus, laughing, stood up in the top
as if getting ready more presents to drop
and as the fond father the picture surveyed
he thought for his trouble he had amply been paid
and he said to himself as he brushed off a tear
i've enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before
what care i if bank-stocks fall ten per cent more
hereafter i'll make it a rule, i believe
to have santa claus visit us each christmas eve
so thinking he gently extinguished the light
and tripped down the stairs to retire for the night

as soon as the beams of the bright morning sun
put the darkness to flight, and the stars, one by one
four little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide
and at the same moment the presents espied
then out of their beds they sprang with a bound
and the very gifts prayed for were all of them found
they laughed and they cried in their innocent glee
and shouted for papa to come quick and see
what presents old santa claus brought in the night
while dear little willie climbed up on his knee
determined no secret between them should be
and told in soft whispers how annie had said
that their blessed mamma, so long ago dead
used to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair
and that god, up in heaven, had answered her prayer
and dod answered our payers; now wasn't he dood

and knew just what presents my children would please
well, well, let him think so, the dear little elf

blind father! who caused your proud heart to relent
and the hasty word spoken so soon to repent
and made you his agent to answer their prayers



i wandered lonely where the pine-trees made
against the bitter east their barricade
and, guided by its sweet
perfume, i found, within a narrow dell
the trailing spring flower tinted like a shell
amid dry leaves and mosses at my feet

from under dead boughs, for whose loss the pines
moaned ceaseless overhead, the blossoming vines
lifted their glad surprise
while yet the bluebird smoothed in leafless trees
his feathers ruffled by the chill sea-breeze
and snow-drifts lingered under april skies

as, pausing, o'er the lonely flower i bent
i thought of lives thus lowly clogged and pent
which yet find room
through care and cumber, coldness and decay
to lend a sweetness to the ungenial day
and make the sad earth happier for their bloom

an old lady sat in her old arm-chair
with wrinkled visage and disheveled hair
and pale and hunger-worn features
for days and for weeks her only fare
as she sat there in her old arm-chair
had been potatoes

but now they were gone; of bad or good
not one was left for the old lady's food
of those potatoes
and she sighed and said, "what shall i do
where shall i send, and to whom shall i go
for more potatoes

and she thought of the deacon over the way
the deacon so ready to worship and pray
whose cellar was full of potatoes
and she said: "i will send for the deacon to come
he'll not mind much to give me some
of such a store of potatoes

and the deacon came over as fast as he could
thinking to do the old lady some good
but never thought of potatoes
he asked her at once what was her chief want
and she, simple soul, expecting a grant
immediately answered, "potatoes

but the deacon's religion didn't lie that way
he was more accustomed to preach and pray
than to give of his hoarded potatoes
so, not hearing, of course, what the old lady said
he rose to pray with uncovered head
but _she_ only thought of potatoes

he prayed for patience, and wisdom, and grace
but when he prayed, "lord, give her peace
she audibly sighed "give potatoes
and at the end of each prayer which he said
he heard, or thought that he heard in its stead
the same request for potatoes

the deacon was troubled; knew not what to do
about "those carnal potatoes
so, ending his prayer, he started for home
as the door closed behind him, he heard a deep groan

and that groan followed him all the way home
in the midst of the night it haunted his room
he could bear it no longer; arose and dressed
from his well-filled cellar taking in haste
a bag of his best potatoes

again he went to the widow's lone hut
her sleepless eyes she had not shut
but there she sat in that old arm-chair
with the same wan features, the same sad air
and, entering in, he poured on the floor
a bushel or more from his goodly store
of choicest potatoes

the widow's cup was running o'er
her face was haggard and wan no more
and he kneeled him down on the sanded floor
where he had poured his goodly store
and such a prayer the deacon prayed
as never before his lips essayed
no longer embarrassed, but free and full
he poured out the voice of a liberal soul
and the widow responded aloud "amen
but spake no more of potatoes

and would you, who hear this simple tale
pray for the poor, and praying, "prevail
then preface your prayers with alms and good deeds
search out the poor, their wants and their needs
pray for peace, and grace, and spiritual food
for wisdom and guidance,-for all these are good



three little words you often see
are articles _a_, _an_, and _the
a noun's the name of anything
as _house_ or _garden_, _hoop_ or _swing
instead of nouns the pronouns stand
adjectives tell the kind of noun
as _great_, _small_, _pretty_, _white_ or _brown
verbs tell something to be done
to _read_, _count_, _sing_, _laugh_ or _run
how things are done the adverbs tell
as _slowly_, _quickly_, _ill_ or _well
conjunctions join the words together
as men _and_ women, wind _or_ weather
the preposition stands before
a noun, as _in_ or _through_ a door
the interjection shows surprise
as _oh!_ how pretty, _ah!_ how wise
the whole are called nine parts of speech
which reading, writing, speaking teach


he came to my desk with, quivering lip
the lesson was done
i took the old leaf, stained and blotted
and gave him a new one all unspotted
and into his sad eyes smiled

i went to the throne with a quivering soul
the old year was done
i have spoiled this one
he took the old leaf, stained and blotted
and gave me a new one all unspotted
and into my sad heart smiled



how are you hoeing your row, my boy
say, how are you hoeing your row
do you hoe it fair
do you hoe it square
do you hoe it the best that you know
do you cut out the weeds as you ought to do
do you plant what is beautiful there
for the harvest, you know
will be just what you sow
are you working it on the square

say, are you killing the weeds, my boy
are you hoeing your row neat and clean
are you going straight
at a hustling gait
are you cutting out all that is mean
do you whistle and sing as you toil along
are you finding your work a delight
if you do it this way
you will gladden the day
and your row will be tended right

hoeing your row with a will, my boy
and giving it thought and care
will insure success
and your efforts bless
as the crop to the garner you bear
for the world will look on as you hoe your row
and will judge you by that which you do
therefore, try for first prize
though your utmost it tries
for the harvest depends on you



fling it from mast and steeple
symbol o'er land and sea
of the life of a happy people
gallant and strong and free
proudly we view its colors
flag of the brave and true
with the clustered stars and the steadfast bars
the red, the white, and the blue

flag of the fearless-hearted
flag of the broken chain
flag in a day-dawn started
never to pale or wane
dearly we prize its colors
with the heaven light breaking through
the clustered stars and the steadfast bars
the red, the white, and the blue

flag of the sturdy fathers
flag of the loyal sons
beneath its folds it gathers
earth's best and noblest ones
boldly we wave its colors
our veins are thrilled anew
by the steadfast bars, the clustered stars
the red, the white, and the blue



hey! little evergreens
sturdy and strong
summer and autumn-time
hasten along
harvest the sunbeams, then
bind them in sheaves
range them and change them
to tufts of green leaves
delve in the mellow-mold
far, far below
and so
little evergreens, grow
grow! grow
grow, little evergreens, grow

up, up so airily
to the blue sky
lift up your leafy tips
stately and high
clasp tight your tiny cones
tawny and brown
by and by buffeting
rains will pelt down
by and by bitterly
chill winds will blow
and so
little evergreens, grow
grow! grow
grow, little evergreens, grow

gather all uttermost
beauty, because
hark, till i tell it now
how santa claus
out of the northern land
over the seas
soon shall come seeking you
evergreen trees
seek you with reindeer soon
over the snow
and so
little evergreens, grow
grow! grow
grow, little evergreens, grow

what if the maple flare
flaunting and red
you shall wear waxen white
taper instead
what if now, otherwhere
birds are beguiled
you shall yet nestle
the little christ-child
ah! the strange splendor
the fir-trees shall know
and so
little evergreens, grow
grow! grow
grow, little evergreens, grow



the sun's heat will give out in ten million years more
and he worried about it
it will sure give out then, if it doesn't before
and he worried about it
it will surely give out, so the scientists said
in all scientifical books he had read
and the whole boundless universe then will be dead
and he worried about it

and some day the earth will fall into the sun
and he worried about it
just as sure and as straight as if shot from a gun
and he worried about it
when strong gravitation unbuckles her straps
it will come in a few million ages, perhaps
and he worried about it

and the earth will become much too small for the race
and he worried about it
when we'll pay thirty dollars an inch for pure space
and he worried about it
the earth will be crowded so much, without doubt
that there won't be room for one's tongue to stick out
nor room for one's thought to wander about
and he worried about it

and the gulf stream will curve, and new england grow torrider
and he worried about it
than was ever the climate of southernmost florida
and he worried about it
our ice crop will be knocked into small smithereens
and crocodiles block up our mowing-machines
and we'll lose our fine crops of potatoes and beans
and he worried about it

and in less than ten thousand years, there's no doubt
and he worried about it
our supply of lumber and coal will give out
and he worried about it
just then the ice-age will return cold and raw
frozen men will stand stiff with arms outstretched in awe
as if vainly beseeching a general thaw
and he worried about it

his wife took in washing--half a dollar a day
he didn't worry about it
his daughter sewed shirts the rude grocer to pay
he didn't worry about it
while his wife beat her tireless rub-a-dub-dub
on the washboard drum of her old wooden tub
he sat by the stoves and he just let her rub
he didn't worry about it



no gilt or tinsel taints the dress
of him who holds the natal power
no weighty helmet's fastenings press
on brow that shares columbia's dower
no blaring trumpets mark the step
of him with mind on peace intent
and so--hats off! here comes the state
a modest king

no cavalcade with galloping squads
surrounds this man, whose mind controls
the actions of the million minds
whose hearts the starry banner folds
instead, in simple garb he rides
the king to whom grim fate has lent
her dower of righteousness and faith
to guide his will

the ancient lands are struck with awe
here stands a power at which they  scoffed
kings, rulers, scribes of pristine states
are dazed,--at columbia they mocked
yet human wills have forged new states
their wills on justice full intent
and fashioned here a lowly king
the people's choice

war-ravaged, spent, and torn--old worlds
with hatred rent, turn to the west
on every side our kingdom's pressed
and see! columbia hastens forth
her healing hand to peace is lent
her sword unsheathed has forged the calm
her sons sent by

full many a storm has tossed the barque
since first it had its maiden trip
full many a conflagration's spark
has scorched and seared the laboring ship
and yet it ploughs a straightway course
through wrack of billows; wind-tossed, spent
on sails the troubled ship of state
steered forward by

stand up! hats off! he's coming by
no roll of drums peals at his course
now give a cheer! he's part of you
your will with his: the nation's force
and--as he passes--breathe a prayer
may justice to his mind be lent
and may the grace of heaven be with
the man who rules



sleepy little, creepy little goblins in the gloaming
with their airy little, fairy little faces all aglow
winking little, blinking little brownies gone a-roaming
hear the rustling little, bustling little footfalls as they go
laughing little, chaffing little voices sweetly singing
in the dearest little, queerest little baby lullabies
creep! creep! creep
time to go to sleep
baby playing 'possum with his big brown eyes

cricket in the thicket with the oddest little clatter
sings his rattling little, prattling little, tattling little tune
fleet the feet of tiny stars go patter, patter, patter
as they scamper from the heavens at the rising of the moon
beaming little, gleaming little fireflies go dreaming
to the dearest little, queerest little baby lullabies
creep! creep! creep
time to go to sleep
baby playing 'possum with his big brown eyes

quaking little, shaking little voices all a-quiver
in the mushy little, rushy little, weedy, reedy bogs
droning little, moaning little chorus by the river
in the croaking little, joking little cadence of the frogs
eerie little, cheery little glowworms in the gloaming
where the clover heads like fairy little nightcaps rise
creep! creep! creep
time to go to sleep
baby playing 'possum with his big brown eyes



if we should be shipwrecked together
and only had water for one
and it was the hottest of weather
right out in the boiling sun
he'd tell me--no matter how bad he
might want it--to take a drink first
and then he would smile--oh, so glad he
had saved me!--and perish from thirst

or, if we were lost on the prairie
and only had food for a day
he'd come and would give me the share he
had wrapped up and hidden away
and after i ate it with sadness
he'd smile with his very last breath
and lay himself down full of gladness
to save me--and starve right to death

and if i was wounded in battle
and out where great danger might be
he'd come through the roar and the rattle
of guns and of bullets to me
he'd carry me out, full of glory
no matter what trouble he had
and then he would fall down, all gory
with wounds, and would die--but be glad

we're chums--that's the reason he'd do it
and that's what a chum ought to be
and if it was fire he'd go through it
if i should call him to me
you see other fellows may know you
and friends that you have go and come
but a boy has one boy he can go to
for help all the time--that's his chum



jim brady's big brother's a wonderful lad
and wonderful, wonderful muscles he had
he swung by one arm from the limb of a tree
and hung there while jim counted up forty-three
just as slow as he could; and he leaped at a bound
across a wide creek and lit square on the ground
just as light as a deer; and the things he can do
so jimmy told us, you would hardly think true

jim brady's big brother could throw a fly ball
from center to home just like nothing at all
and often while playing a game he would stand
and take a high fly with just only one hand
jim brady showed us where he knocked a home run
and won the big game when it stood three to one
against the home team, and jim brady, he showed
the place where it lit in the old wagon road

jim brady's big brother could bat up a fly
that you hardly could see, for it went up so high
he'd bring up his muscle and break any string
that you tied on his arm like it wasn't a thing
he used to turn handsprings, and cartwheels, and he
could jump through his hands just as slick as could be
and circuses often would want him to go
and be in the ring, but his mother said no

jim brady's big brother would often make bets
with boys that he'd turn two complete summersets
from off of the spring-board before he would dive
and you'd hardly think he would come up alive
and nobody else who went there to swim
could do it, but it was just easy for him
and they'd all be scared, so jim said, when he'd stay
in under and come up a half mile away

jim brady's big brother, so jim said, could run
five miles in a race just as easy as one
right often he walked on his hands half a block
and could have walked more if he'd wanted to walk
and jimmy says wait till he comes home from school
where he is gone now, and some day, when it's cool
he'll get him to prove everything to be true
that jimmy told us his big brother could do



is my little lad, my elihu
a-sailing with your ship
the sailor's eyes were dim with dew
he said with trembling lip

another such a one as he
what little lad, do you say
why, elihu, that took to the sea
the moment i put him off my knee
it was just the other day
the _gray swan_ sailed away

stood open with a great surprise
his heart began in his throat to rise
the jacket he had on

with her anchor clutching hold of the sand
for a month, and never stir
like a lover kissing his lady's hand
the wild sea kissing her
a sight to remember, sir

all this was twenty years ago
i stood on the _gray swan's_ deck
and to that lad i saw you throw
taking it off, as it might be, so
the kerchief from your neck

that has made you sick and made you sad
sail with the _gray swan's_ crew
the best boy ever mother had
be sure he sailed with the crew
what would you have him do

nor sent you word, nor made you sign
to say he was alive
besides, he may be in the brine
and could he write from the grave
tut, man, what would you have

but if the lad still live
and come back home, think you you can
forgive him?"--"miserable man
you're mad as the sea,--you rave
what have i to forgive

the sailor twitched his shirt so blue
and from within his bosom drew
the kerchief. she was wild
my little lad, my elihu
my blessed boy, my child
my dead,--my living child




the joys of living wreathe my face
my heart keeps time to freshet's race
of balmy airs i drink my fill
why, there's a yellow daffodil
along the stream a soft green tinge
gives hint of feathery willow fringe
methinks i heard a robin's "cheer
i'm glad spring's here


an afternoon of buzzing flies
heat waves that sear, and quivering rise
the long white road, the plodding team
the deep, cool grass in which to dream
the distant cawing of the crows
tall, waving grain, long orchard rows
the peaceful cattle in the stream
midsummer's dream


a cold, gray day, a lowering sky
a lonesome pigeon wheeling by
the soft, blue smoke that hangs and fades
the shivering crane that flaps and wades
dead leaves that, whispering, quit their tree
the peace the river sings to me
the chill aloofness of the fall
i love it all


a sheet of ice, the ring of steel
the crunch of snow beneath the heel
loud, jingling bells, the straw-lined sleigh
a restless pair that prance and neigh
the early coming of the night
red glowing logs, a shaded light
the firelit realm of books is mine
oh, winter's fine





hamelin town's in brunswick
by famous hanover city
the river weser, deep and wide
washes its wall on the southern side
a pleasanter spot you never spied
but, when begins my ditty
almost five hundred years ago
to see the townsfolk suffer so
from vermin, was a pity


they fought the dogs and killed the cats
and bit the babies in the cradles
and ate the cheeses out of the vats
and licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles
split open the kegs of salted sprats
made nests inside men's sunday hats
and even spoiled the women's chats
by drowning their speaking
with shrieking and squeaking
in fifty different sharps and flats


at last the people in a body
to the town hall came flocking
and as for our corporation--shocking
to think we buy gowns lined with ermine
for dolts that can't or won't determine
what's best to rid us of our vermin
you hope, because you're old and obese
to find in the furry civic robe ease
rouse up, sirs! give your brains a racking
to find the remedy we're lacking
or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing
at this the mayor and corporation
quaked with a mighty consternation


an hour they sat in council
at length the mayor broke silence
i wish i were a mile hence
it's easy to bid one rack one's brain
i'm sure my poor head aches again
i've scratched it so, and all in vain
oh, for a trap, a trap, a trap
just as he said this, what should hap
at the chamber-door but a gentle tap
looking little though wondrous fat
nor brighter was his eye, nor moister
than a too-long-opened oyster
save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous
for a plate of turtle green and glutinous
anything like the sound of a rat
makes my heart go pit-a-pat


and in did come the strangest figure
his queer long coat from heel to head
was half of yellow and half of red
and he himself was tall and thin
with sharp blue eyes, each like a pin
and light loose hair, yet swarthy skin
no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin
but lips where smiles went out and in
there was no guessing his kith and kin
and nobody could enough admire
the tall man and his quaint attire
quoth one: "it's as my great-grandsire
starting up at the trump of doom's tone
had walked this way from his painted tombstone


he advanced to the council-table
and, "please your honours," said he, "i'm able
by means of a secret charm, to draw
all creatures living beneath the sun
that creep or swim or fly or run
after me so as you never saw
and i chiefly use my charm
on creatures that do people harm
the mole and toad and newt and viper
and people call me the pied piper
a scarf of red and yellow stripe
to match with his coat of the self-same cheque
and at the scarf's end hung a pipe
and his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying
as if impatient to be playing
upon this pipe, as low it dangled
over his vesture so old-fangled
in tartary i freed the cham
last june, from his huge swarms of gnats
i eased in asia the nizam
of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats
and as for what your brain bewilders
if i can rid your town of rats
will you give me a thousand guilders
of the astonished mayor and corporation


into the street the piper stept
smiling first a little smile
as if he knew what magic slept
in his quiet pipe the while
then, like a musical adept
to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled
and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled
like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled
and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered
you heard as if an army muttered
and the muttering grew to a grumbling
and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling
and out of the houses the rats came tumbling
great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats
brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats
grave old plodders, gay young friskers
fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins
cocking tails and pricking whiskers
families by tens and dozens
brothers, sisters, husbands, wives
followed the piper for their lives
from street to street he piped advancing
and step for step they followed dancing
until they came to the river weser
wherein all plunged and perished
swam across and lived to carry
to rat-land home his commentary
which was, "at the first shrill notes of the pipe
i heard a sound as of scraping tripe
and putting apples, wondrous ripe
into a cider-press's gripe
and a moving away of pickle-tub-boards
and a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards
and a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks
and a breaking the hoops of butter-casks
and it seemed as if a voice
is breathed) called out, 'oh, rats, rejoice
the world is grown to one vast drysaltery
so munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon
breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon
and just as a bulky sugar-puncheon
all ready staved, like a great sun shone
glorious scarce an inch before me
just as methought it said, 'come, bore me


you should have heard the hamelin people
ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple
poke out the nests and block up the holes
consult with carpenters and builders
and leave in our town not even a trace
of the rats!"--when suddenly, up the face
of the piper perked in the market-place
with a, "first, if you please, my thousand guilders


a thousand guilders! the mayor looked blue
so did the corporation, too
for council dinners made rare havoc
with claret, moselle, vin-de-grave, hock
and half the money would replenish
their cellar's biggest butt with rhenish
to pay this sum to a wandering fellow
with a gypsy coat of red and yellow
we saw with our eyes the vermin sink
and what's dead can't come to life, i think
so, friend, we're not the folks to shrink
from the duty of giving you something for drink
and a matter of money to put in your poke
but as for the guilders, what we spoke
of them, as you very well know, was in joke
beside, our losses have made us thrifty
a thousand guilders! come, take fifty


the piper's face fell, and he cried
i've promised to visit by dinner-time
bagdat, and accept the prime
of the head-cook's pottage, all he's rich in
for having left, in the caliph's kitchen
of a nest of scorpions no survivor
with him i proved no bargain-driver
with you, don't think i'll bate a stiver
and folks who put me in a passion
may find me pipe after another fashion


being worse treated than a cook
insulted by a lazy ribald
with idle pipe and vesture piebald
you threaten us, fellow? do your worst
blow your pipe there till you burst


once more he stept into the street
and to his lips again
laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane
and ere he blew three notes (such sweet
soft notes as yet musician's cunning
never gave the enraptured air
there was a rustling that seemed like a bustling
of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling
small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering
little hands clapping and little tongues chattering
and, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering
out came the children running
all the little boys and girls
with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls
and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls
tripping and skipping, ran merrily after
the wonderful music with shouting and laughter


the mayor was dumb, and the council stood
as if they were changed into blocks of wood
unable to move a step, or cry
to the children merrily skipping by
that joyous crowd at the piper's back
but how the mayor was on the rack
and the wretched council's bosoms beat
as the piper turned from the high street
to where the weser rolled its waters
right in the way of their sons and daughters
however, he turned from south to west
and to koppelberg hill his steps addressed
and after him the children pressed
great was the joy in every breast
he's forced to let the piping drop
and we shall see our children stop
when, lo, as they reached the mountainside
a wondrous portal opened wide
as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed
and the piper advanced and the children followed
and when all were in to the very last
the door in the mountainside shut fast
did i say, all? no! one was lame
and could not dance the whole of the way
and in after years, if you would blame
his sadness, he was used to say
i can't forget that i'm bereft
of all the pleasant sights they see
which the piper also promised me
for he led us, he said, to a joyous land
joining the town and just at hand
where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew
and flowers put forth a fairer hue
and everything was strange and new
the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here
and their dogs outran our fallow deer
and honey-bees had lost their stings
and horses were born with eagles' wings
and just as i became assured
my lame foot would be speedily cured
the music stopped and i stood still
and found myself outside the hill
left alone against my will
to go now limping as before
and never hear of that country more


alas, alas for hamelin
there came into many a burgher's pate
a text which says that heaven's gate
opes to the rich at as easy rate
as the needle's eye takes a camel in
the mayor sent east, west, north, and south
to offer the piper, by word of mouth
wherever it was men's lot to find him
silver and gold to his heart's content
if he'd only return the way he went
and bring the children behind him
but when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour
and piper and dancers were gone for ever
they made a decree that lawyers never
should think their records dated duly
if, after the day of the month and year
these words did not as well appear
on the twenty-second of july
thirteen hundred and seventy-six
and the better in memory to fix
the place of the children's last retreat
they called it, the pied piper's street
where any one playing on pipe or tabour
was sure for the future to lose his labour
nor suffered they hostelry or tavern
to shock with mirth a street so solemn
but opposite the place of the cavern
they wrote the story on a column
and on the great church-window painted
the same, to make the world acquainted
how their children were stolen away
and there it stands to this very day
and i must not omit to say
that in transylvania there's a tribe
of alien people who ascribe
the outlandish ways and dress
on which their neighbours lay such stress
to their fathers and mothers having risen
out of some subterraneous prison
into which they were trepanned
long time ago in a mighty band
out of hamelin town in brunswick land
but how or why, they don't understand


so, willy, let me and you be wipers
of scores out with all men--especially pipers
and, whether they pipe us free fróm rats or fróm mice
if we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise



on the sea and at the hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two
did the english fight the french,--woe to france
and, the thirty-first of may, helter-skelter through the blue
like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue
came crowding ship on ship to saint malo on the rance
with the english fleet in view


first and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, damfreville
close on him fled, great and small
twenty-two good ships in all
and they signalled to the place
get us guidance, give us harbour, take us quick--or, quicker still
here's the english can and will


then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board
laughed they
and scored
shall the _formidable_ here with her twelve and eighty guns
think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way
trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons
and with flow at full beside
now, 'tis slackest ebb of tide
reach the mooring? rather say
while rock stands or water runs
not a ship will leave the bay


then was called a council straight
brief and bitter the debate
all that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow
for a prize to plymouth sound
better run the ships aground
let the captains all and each
shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach
france must undergo her fate


was ever spoke or heard
for up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these
no such man of mark, and meet
with his betters to compete
but a simple breton sailor pressed by tourville for the fleet
a poor coasting-pilot he, hervé riel the croisickese


and "what mockery or malice have we here?" cries hervé riel
talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell
on my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell
are you bought by english gold? is it love the lying's for
morn and eve, night and day
have i piloted your bay
entered free and anchored fast at the foot of solidor
burn the fleet and ruin france? that were worse than fifty hogues
sirs, they know i speak the truth! sirs, believe me there's a way
only let me lead the line
have the biggest ship to steer
get this _formidable_ clear
make the others follow mine
and i lead them, most and least, by a passage i know well
right to solidor past grève
and there lay them safe and sound
and if one ship misbehave
why, i've nothing but my life,--here's my head!" cries hervé riel


not a minute more to wait
take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!" cried its chief
captains, give the sailor place
he is admiral, in brief
still the north wind, by god's grace
see the noble fellow's face
as the big ship, with a bound
clears the entry like a hound
keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound
see, safe through shoal and rock
how they follow in a flock
not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground
not a spar that comes to grief
the peril, see, is past
all are harboured to the last
and just as hervé riel hollas "anchor!"--sure as fate
up the english come--too late


so, the storm subsides to calm
they see the green trees wave
on the heights o'erlooking grève
hearts that bled are stanched with balm
let the english rake the bay
gnash their teeth and glare askance
as they cannonade away
how hope succeeds despair on each captain's countenance
out burst all with one accord
let france, let france's king
thank the man that did the thing
what a shout, and all one word
as he stepped in front once more
not a symptom of surprise
in the frank blue breton eyes
just the same man as before


then said damfreville, "my friend
i must speak out at the end
though i find the speaking hard
praise is deeper than the lips
you have saved the king his ships
you must name your own reward
demand whate'er you will
france remains your debtor still
ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not damfreville


then a beam of fun outbroke
on the bearded mouth that spoke
as the honest heart laughed through
those frank eyes of breton blue
since on board the duty's done
and from malo roads to croisic point, what is it but a run
since 'tis ask and have, i may
since the others go ashore
come! a good whole holiday
leave to go and see my wife, whom i call the belle aurore
that he asked and that he got,--nothing more


name and deed alike are lost
not a pillar nor a post
in his croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell
not a head in white and black
on a single fishing-smack
in memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
all that france saved from the fight whence england bore the bell
go to paris: rank on rank
search the heroes flung pell-mell
on the louvre, face and flank
you shall look long enough ere you come to hervé riel
so, for better and for worse
hervé riel, accept my verse
in my verse, hervé riel, do thou once more
save the squadron, honour france, love thy wife the belle aurore




kentish sir byng stood for his king
bidding the crop-headed parliament swing
and, pressing a troop unable to stoop

marched them along, fifty-score strong
great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song

i sprang to the stirrup, and joris, and he
i galloped, dirck galloped, we galloped all three
behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest
and into the midnight we galloped abreast

not a word to each other; we kept the great pace
neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place
i turned in my saddle and made its girths tight
then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right
rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit
nor galloped less steadily roland a whit

lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear
at boom, a great yellow star came out to see
at düffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be
and from mecheln church-steeple we heard the half chime
so joris broke silence with, "yet there is time

at aershot, up leaped of a sudden the sun
and against him the cattle stood black every one
to stare through the mist at us galloping past
and i saw my stout galloper roland at last
with resolute shoulders, each butting away
the haze, as some bluff river headland its spray

and his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
for my voice, and the other pricked out on his track
and one eye's black intelligence,--ever that glance
o'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance
and the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon
his fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on

by hasselt, dirck groaned; and cried joris, "stay spur
your roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her
we'll remember at aix"--for one heard the quick wheeze
of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees
and sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank
as down on her haunches she shuddered and sank
past looz and past tongres, no cloud in the sky
the broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh
till over by dalhem a dome-spire sprang white
and "gallop," gasped joris, "for aix is in sight

rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone
and there was my roland to hear the whole weight
of the news which alone could save aix from her fate
with his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim
and with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim

then i cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall
shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all
stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear
called my roland his pet-name, my horse without peer
clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good
till at length into aix roland galloped and stood

and all i remember is--friends flocking round
as i sat with his head, 'twixt my knees on the ground
and no voice but was praising this roland of mine
as i poured down his throat our last measure of wine
which (the burgesses voted by common consent
was no more than his due who brought good news from ghent


as i ride, as i ride
with a full heart for my guide
so its tide rocks my side
as i ride, as i ride
that, as i were double-eyed
he, in whom our tribes confide
is descried, ways untried
as i ride, as i ride

as i ride, as i ride
to our chief and his allied
who dares chide my heart's pride
as i ride, as i ride
or are witnesses denied
through the desert waste and wide
do i glide unespied
as i ride, as i ride

as i ride, as i ride
when an inner voice has cried
the sands slide, nor abide
o'er each visioned homicide
that came vaunting (has he lied
to reside--where he died
as i ride, as i ride

as i ride, as i ride
ne'er has spur my swift horse plied
yet his hide, streaked and pied
as i ride, as i ride
shows where sweat has sprung and dried
how has vied stride with stride
as i ride, as i ride

as i ride, as i ride
could i loose what fate has tied
ere i pried, she should hide
all that's meant me--satisfied
when the prophet and the bride
stop veins i'd have subside
as i ride, as i ride



you know, we french stormed ratisbon
a mile or so away
on a little mound, napoleon
stood on our storming-day
with neck out-thrust, you fancy how
legs wide, arms locked behind
as if to balance the prone brow
oppressive with its mind

just as perhaps he mused "my plans
that soar, to earth may fall
let once my army-leader, lannes
waver at yonder wall
out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew
a rider, bound on bound
full-galloping; nor bridle drew
until he reached the mound

then off there flung in smiling joy
and held himself erect
by just his horse's mane, a boy
you hardly could suspect
scarce any blood came through
you looked twice ere you saw his breast
was all but shot in two

we've got you ratisbon
the marshal's in the market-place
and you'll be there anon
to see your flag-bird flap his vans
where i, to heart's desire
perched him!" the chief's eye flashed; his plans
soared up again like fire

the chief's eye flashed; but presently
softened itself, as sheathes
a film the mother-eagle's eye
when her bruised eaglet breathes
touched to the quick, he said
smiling the boy fell dead


i and clive were friends--and why not? friends! i think you laugh
my lad
clive it was gave england india, while your father gives--egad
england nothing but the graceless boy who lures him on to speak
your cheek
very true: in my eyes, your eyes, all the world's eyes, clive was man
i was, am, and ever shall be--mouse, nay, mouse of all its clan
sorriest sample, if you take the kitchen's estimate for fame
while the man clive--he fought plassy, spoiled the clever foreign
conquered and annexed and englished

never mind! as o'er my punch
black, unbroken,--thought grows busy, thrids each pathway of old
years
notes this forthright, that meander, till the long past life appears
like an outspread map of country plodded through, each mile and rood
once, and well remembered still,--i'm startled in my solitude
ever and anon by--what's the sudden mocking light that breaks
on me as i slap the table till no rummer-glass but shakes
while i ask--aloud, i do believe, god help me!--"was it thus
can it be that so i faltered, stopped when just one step for us
wealth were handy, honour ticklish, did no writing on the wall
warn me "trespasser, 'ware man-traps!" him who braves that
notice--call
hero! none of such heroics suit myself who read plain words
doff my hat, and leap no barrier. scripture says, the land's the
lord's
louts then--what avail the thousand, noisy in a smock-frocked ring
all-agog to have me trespass, clear the fence, be clive their king
higher warrant must you show me ere i set one foot before
t'other in that dark direction, though i stand for evermore
poor as job and meek as moses. evermore? no! by and by
don't object "why call him friend, then?" power is power, my boy
and still
marks a man,--god's gift magnific, exercised for good or ill
you've your boot now on my hearth-rug, tread what was a tiger's skin
rarely such a royal monster as i lodged the bullet in
true, he murdered half a village, so his own death came to pass
still, for size and beauty, cunning, courage--ah, the brute he was
why, that clive,--that youth, that greenhorn, that quill-driving
clerk, in fine
he sustained a siege in arcot ... but the world knows! pass the wine

where did i break off at? how bring clive in? oh, you mentioned
just so: and, said i, that minds me of a story you shall hear

we were friends then, clive and i: so, when the clouds, about the orb
late supreme, encroaching slowly, surely threaten to absorb
ray by ray its noontide brilliance,--friendship might, with
steadier eye
drawing near, hear what had burned else, now no blaze--all majesty
too much bee's-wing floats my figure? well, suppose a castle's new
none presume to climb its ramparts, none find foothold sure for shoe
as his scale-mail's warty iron cuirasses a crocodile
reels that castle thunder-smitten, storm-dismantled? from without
scrambling up by crack and crevice, every cockney prates about
towers--the heap he kicks now! turrets--just the measure of his cane
will that do? observe moreover--(same similitude again
such a castle seldom crumbles by sheer stress of cannonade
invade
grass o'ergrows, o'ergrows till night-birds congregating find no holes
fit to build like the topmost sockets made for banner-poles
so clive crumbled slow in london, crashed at last

a week before
dining with him,--after trying churchyard chat of days of yore
both of us stopped, tired as tombstones, head-piece, foot-piece

if a stranger passed the tent of hóseyn, he cried "a churl's

who started, the owner's hope, gets shamed and named, that day
whom the paddock's lord thrusts forth. right, hóseyn, i say
to laugh

on him i waste nor scorn nor pity, but lavish both
on duhl the son of sheybán, who withers away in heart
for envy of hóseyn's luck. such sickness admits no cure
a certain poet has sung, and sealed the same with an oath

lo, duhl the son of sheybán comes riding to hóseyn's tent
and he casts his saddle down, and enters and "peace!" bids he

who proffer a thousand. speak! long parley may last too long

said hóseyn, "you feed young beasts a many, of famous breed

but i love muléykeh's face: her forefront whitens indeed
like a yellowish wave's cream-crest. your camels--go gaze on them
her fetlock is foam-splashed too. myself am the richer still

a year goes by: lo, back to the tent again rides duhl
why should i speak of sale? be the mare your simple gift
my son is pined to death for her beauty: my wife prompts 'fool
beg for his sake the pearl! be god the rewarder, since
god pays debts seven for one: who squanders on him shows thrift

said hóseyn, "god gives each man one life, like a lamp, then gives
that lamp due measure of oil: lamp lighted--hold high, wave wide
its comfort for others to share! once quench it, what help is left
the oil of your lamp is your son: i shine while muléykeh lives
would i beg your son to cheer my dark if muléykeh died
it is life against life: what good avails to the life-bereft

another year, and--hist! what craft is it duhl designs
he alights not at the door of the tent as he did last time
but, creeping behind, he gropes his stealthy way by the trench
half-round till he finds the flap in the folding, for night combines
with the robber--and such is he: duhl, covetous up to crime
must wring from hóseyn's grasp the pearl, by whatever the wrench

and a gibe was all my thanks. is he generous like spring dew

let him die, then,--let me live! be bold--but not too rash
i have found me a peeping-place: breast, bury your breathing while
i explore for myself! now, breathe! he deceived me not, the spy

stands tethered the pearl: thrice winds her headstall about his wrist
and, loose on his left, stands too that other, known far and wide
buhéyseh, her sister born: fleet is she yet ever missed

what then? the pearl is the pearl: once mount her we both escape
through the skirt-fold in glides duhl,--so a serpent disturbs no leaf
in a bush as he parts the twigs entwining a nest: clean through
he is noiselessly at his work: as he planned, he performs the rape

he has set the tent-door wide, has buckled the girth, has clipped
the headstall away from the wrist he leaves thrice bound as before
he springs on the pearl, is launched on the desert like bolt from bow
up starts our plundered man: from his breast though the heart be
ripped
yet his mind has the mastery: behold, in a minute more
he is out and off and away on buhéyseh, whose worth we know

and hóseyn--his blood turns flame, he has learned long since to ride
and buhéyseh does her part,--they gain--they are gaining fast
on the fugitive pair, and duhl has ed-dárraj to cross and quit
and to reach the ridge el-sabán,--no safety till that he spied
and buhéyseh is, bound by bound, but a horse-length off at last
for the pearl has missed the tap of the heel, the touch of the bit

she shortens her stride, she chafes at her rider the strange and
queer
buhéyseh is mad with hope--beat sister she shall and must
though duhl, of the hand and heel so clumsy, she has to thank
she is near now, nose by tail--they are neck by croup--joy! fear
what folly makes hóseyn shout "dog duhl, damned son of the dust
touch the right ear and press with your foot my pearl's left flank

and duhl was wise at the word, and muléykeh as prompt perceived
who was urging redoubled pace, and to hear him was to obey
and a leap indeed gave she, and evanished for evermore
and hóseyn looked one long last look as who, all bereaved
looks, fain to follow the dead so far as the living may
then he turned buhéyseh's neck slow homeward, weeping sore

and, lo, in the sunrise, still sat hóseyn upon the ground
weeping: and neighbours came, the tribesmen of bénu-asád
in the vale of green er-rass, and they questioned him of his grief
and he told from first to last how, serpent-like, duhl had wound
his way to the nest, and how duhl rode like an ape, so bad
and how buhéyseh did wonders, yet pearl remained with the thief

and they jeered him, one and all: "poor hóseyn is crazed past hope
how else had he wrought himself his ruin, in fortune's spite
to have simply held the tongue were a task for boy or girl
and here were muléykeh again, the eyed like an antelope

sing me a hero! quench my thirst
of soul, ye bards

quoth bard the first
his helm and eke his habergeon
sir olaf and his bard

my hero to some steep, beneath
which precipice smiled tempting death
you too without your host have reckoned

sang to herself at careless play
and fell into the stream. 'dismay
help, you the standers-by!' none stirred

and children ere they risk their lives
over the balustrade has bounced
a mere instinctive dog, and pounced
plumb on the prize. 'how well he dives

in mouth, alive too, clutched from quite
a depth of ten feet--twelve, i bet
good dog! what, off again? there's yet
another child to save? all right

it's instinct in the animal
good dog! but he's a long while under
if he got drowned i should not wonder
strong current, that against the wall

now, did you ever? reason reigns
in man alone, since all tray's pains
have fished--the child's doll from the slime

trotted my hero off,--old tray
till somebody, prerogatived
with reason, reasoned: 'why he dived
his brain would show us, i should say

by vivisection, at expense
of half-an-hour and eighteenpence
how brain secretes dog's soul, we'll see


what a pretty tale you told me
once upon a time
was it prose or was it rhyme
greek or latin? greek, you said
while your shoulder propped my head

anyhow there's no forgetting
this much if no more
that a poet (pray, no petting
yes, a bard, sir, famed of yore
went where suchlike used to go
singing for a prize, you know

well, he had to sing, nor merely
sing but play the lyre
playing was important clearly
quite as singing: i desire
sir, you keep the fact in mind
for a purpose that's behind

there stood he, while deep attention
held the judges round
to detect the slightest sound
sung or played amiss: such ears
had old judges, it appears

none the less he sang out boldly
played in time and tune
till the judges, weighing coldly
each note's worth, seemed, late or soon
sure to smile "in vain one tries
picking faults out: take the prize

when, a mischief! were they seven
strings the lyre possessed
oh, and afterwards eleven
thank you! well, sir,--who had guessed
such ill luck in store?--it happed
one of those same seven strings snapped

all was lost, then! no! a cricket
for mere love of music--flew
with its little heart on fire
lighted on the crippled lyre

so that when (ah, joy!) our singer
for his truant string
feels with disconcerted finger
what does cricket else but fling
fiery heart forth, sound the note
wanted by the throbbing throat

ay, and ever to the ending
cricket chirps at need
executes the hand's intending
promptly, perfectly,--indeed
saves the singer from defeat
with her chirrup low and sweet

till, at ending, all the judges
cry with one assent
such a voice and instrument
why, we took your lyre for harp
so it shrilled us forth f sharp

did the conqueror spurn the creature
once its service done
that's no such uncommon feature
in the case when music's son
finds his lotte's power too spent
for aiding soul-development

no! this other, on returning
homeward, prize in hand
satisfied his bosom's yearning
of this cricket's help to me

so, he made himself a statue
marble stood, life-size
on the lyre, he pointed at you
perched his partner in the prize
never more apart you found
her, he throned, from him, she crowned

that's the tale: its application
somebody i know
hopes one day for reputation
through his poetry that's--oh
all so learned and so wise
and deserving of a prize

if he gains one, will some ticket
when his statue's built
tell the gazer "'twas a cricket
helped my crippled lyre, whose lilt
sweet and low, when strength usurped
softness' place i' the scale, she chirped

while i sang and played
with my lyre at lowest, highest
right alike,--one string that made
never to be heard again

perched upon the place
vacant left, and duly uttered
asked the treble to atone
for its somewhat sombre drone

but you don't know music! wherefore
keep on casting pearls
to a--poet? all i care for
is--to tell him that a girl's
grows his singing. (there, enough



oh, the beautiful girl, too white
who lived at pornic, down by the sea
just where the sea and the loire unite
and a boasted name in brittany
she bore, which i will not write

too white, for the flower of life is red
her flesh was the soft seraphic screen
of a soul that is meant (her parents said
to just see earth, and hardly be seen
and blossom in heaven instead

yet earth saw one thing, one how fair
one grace that grew to its full on earth
smiles might be sparse on her cheek so spare
and her waist want half a girdle's girth
but she had her great gold hair

hair, such a wonder of flix and floss
freshness and fragrance--floods of it, too
gold, did i say? nay, gold's mere dross
here, life smiled, "think what i meant to do
and love sighed, "fancy my loss

so, when she died, it was scarce more strange
than that, when delicate evening dies
and you follow its spent sun's pallid range
there's a shoot of colour startles the skies
with sudden, violent change

that, while the breath was nearly to seek
as they put the little cross to her lips
she changed; a spot came out on her cheek
a spark from her eye in mid-eclipse
and she broke forth, "i must speak

but the last, last grace, my all, my own
let it stay in the grave, that the ghosts may know
leave my poor gold hair alone

the passion thus vented, dead lay she
her parents sobbed their worst on that
all friends joined in, nor observed degree
for indeed the hair was to wonder at
as it spread--not flowing free

but curled around her brow, like a crown
and coiled beside her cheeks, like a cap
and calmed about her neck--ay, down
to her breast, pressed flat, without a gap
i' the gold, it reached her gown

all kissed that face, like a silver wedge
e'en the priest allowed death's privilege
as he planted the crucifix with care
on her breast, 'twixt edge and edge

and thus was she buried, inviolate
of body and soul, in the very space
by the altar; keeping saintly state
in pornic church, for her pride of race
pure life and piteous fate

and in after-time would your fresh tear fall
though your mouth might twitch with a dubious smile
as they told you of gold, both robe and pall
how she prayed them leave it alone awhile
so it never was touched at all

years flew; this legend grew at last
the life of the lady; all she had done
all been, in the memories fading fast
of lover and friend, was summed in one
sentence survivors passed

to wit, she was meant for heaven, not earth
had turned an angel before the time
yet, since she was mortal, in such dearth
of frailty, all you could count a crime
was--she knew her gold hair's worth

it chanced, the pavement wanted repair
was taken to pieces: left in the lurch
a certain sacred space lay bare
and the boys began research

a benefactor,--a bishop, suppose
a baron with armour-adornments quaint
dame with chased ring and jewelled rose
things sanctity saves from taint

so we come to find them in after-days
when the corpse is presumed to have done with gauds
of use to the living, in many ways
for the boys get pelf, and the town applauds
and the church deserves the praise

they grubbed with a will: and at length--_o cor
humanum, pectora cæca_, and the rest
they found--no gaud they were prying for
no ring, no rose, but--who would have guessed
a double louis-d'or

here was a case for the priest: he heard
marked, inwardly digested, laid
finger on nose, smiled, "there's a bird
chirps in my ear:" then, "bring a spade
dig deeper!"--he gave the word

and lo, when they came to the coffin-lid
or rotten planks which composed it once
why, there lay the girl's skull wedged amid
a mint of money, it served for the nonce
to hold in its hair-heaps hid

hid there? why? could the girl be wont
money, earth's trash and heaven's affront
had a spider found out the communion-cup
was a toad in the christening-font

truth is truth: too true it was
gold! she hoarded and hugged it first
longed for it, leaned o'er it, loved it--alas
till the humour grew to a head and burst
and she cried, at the final pass

nor lover nor friend--be gold for both
gold i lack; and, my all, my own
it shall hide in my hair. i scarce die loth
if they let my hair alone

louis-d'or, some six times five
and duly double, every piece
now, do you see? with the priest to shrive
with parents preventing her soul's release
by kisses that kept alive

with heaven's gold gates about to ope
with friends' praise, gold-like, lingering still
an instinct had bidden the girl's hand grope
for gold, the true sort--"gold in heaven, if you will
but i keep earth's too, i hope

enough! the priest took the grave's grim yield
the parents, they eyed that price of sin
as if _thirty pieces_ lay revealed
on the place _to bury strangers in
the hideous potter's field

but the priest bethought him: "'milk that's spilt
saints tumble to earth with so slight a tilt
it would build a new altar; that, we may
and the altar therewith was built

why i deliver this horrible verse
as the text of a sermon, which now i preach
evil or good may be better or worse
in the human heart, but the mixture of each
is a marvel and a curse

the candid incline to surmise of late
that the christian faith proves false, i find
for our essays-and-reviews' debate
begins to tell on the public mind
and colenso's words have weight

i still, to suppose it true, for my part
see reasons and reasons; this, to begin
at the head of a lie--taught original sin
the corruption of man's heart


do you happen to know in ross-shire
mount ben ... but the name scarce matters
of the naked fact i am sure enough
though i clothe it in rags and tatters

you may recognise ben by description
behind him--a moor's immenseness
up goes the middle mount of a range
fringed with its firs in denseness

rimming the edge, its fir-fringe, mind
for an edge there is, though narrow
from end to end of the range, a strip
of path runs straight as an arrow

and the mountaineer who takes that path
saves himself miles of journey
he has to plod if he crosses the moor
through heather, peat, and burnie

but a mountaineer he needs must be
for, look you, right in the middle
projects bluff ben--with an end in _ich
why planted there, is a riddle

since all ben's brothers little and big
keep rank, set shoulder to shoulder
and only this burliest out must bulge
till it seems--to the beholder

from down in the gully,--as if ben's breast
to a sudden spike diminished
would signify to the boldest foot

yet the mountaineer who sidles on
and on to the very bending
discovers, if heart and brain be proof
no necessary ending

foot up, foot down, to the turn abrupt
having trod, he, there arriving
finds--what he took for a point was breadth
a mercy of nature's contriving

so, he rounds what, when 'tis reached, proves straight
from one side gains the other
the wee path widens--resume the march
and he foils you, ben my brother

but donald--(that name, i hope, will do
i wrong him if i call "foiling
the tramp of the callant, whistling the while
as blithe as our kettle's boiling

he had dared the danger from boyhood up
and now,--when perchance was waiting
a lass at the brig below,--'twixt mount
and moor would he standing debating

moreover this donald was twenty-five
a glory of bone and muscle
did a fiend dispute the right of way
donald would try a tussle

lightsomely marched he out of the broad
on to the narrow and narrow
a step more, rounding the angular rock
reached the front straight as an arrow

he stepped it, safe on the ledge he stood
when--whom found he full-facing
what fellow in courage and wariness too
had scouted ignoble pacing

and left low safety to timid mates
and made for the dread dear danger
and gained the height where--who could guess
he would meet with a rival ranger

gigantic and magnific
by the wonder--ay, and the peril--struck
intelligent and pacific

for a red deer is no fallow deer
grown cowardly through park-feeding
he batters you like a thunderbolt
if you brave his haunts unheeding

i doubt he could hardly perform _volte-face
had valour advised discretion
you may walk on a rope, but to turn on a rope
no blondin makes profession

yet donald must turn, would pride permit
though pride ill brooks retiring
each eyed each--mute man, motionless beast
less fearing than admiring

these are the moments when quite new sense
to meet some need as novel
springs up in the brain: it inspired resource

and slowly, surely, never a whit
relaxing the steady tension
of eye-stare which binds man to beast
by an inch and inch declension

sank donald sidewise down and down
till flat, breast upwards, lying
at his six-foot length, no corpse more still

minutes were an eternity
but a new sense was created
in the stag's brain too; he resolves! slow, sure
with eye-stare unabated

feelingly he extends a foot
which tastes the way ere it touches
earth's solid and just escapes man's soft
nor hold of the same unclutches

till its fellow foot, light as a feather whisk
lands itself no less finely
so a mother removes a fly from the face
of her babe asleep supinely

and now 'tis the haunch and hind-foot's turn
yes, traversing half the prostrate length
his hoof-tip does not graze it

just one more lift! but donald, you see
was sportsman first, man after
a fancy lightened his caution through

unrivalled, unexampled
all sporting feats with this feat matched
were down and dead and trampled

the last of the legs as tenderly
follows the rest: or never
or now is the time! his knife in reach
and his right hand loose--how clever

for this can stab up the stomach's soft
while the left hand grasps the pastern
a rise on the elbow, and--now's the time
or never: this turn's the last turn

i shall dare to place myself by god
who scanned--for he does--each feature
of the face thrown up in appeal to him
by the agonising creature

nay, i hear plain words: "thy gift brings this
up he sprang, back he staggered
over he fell, and with him our friend

yet he was not dead when they picked next day
from the gully's depth the wreck of him
his fall had been stayed by the stag beneath
who cushioned and saved the neck of him

but the rest of his body--why, doctors said
whatever could break was broken
legs, arms, ribs, all of him looked like a toast
in a tumbler of port wine soaken

said they when--the slow cure ended
they opened the hospital door, and thence

and minor damage left wisely alone
like an old shoe clouted and cobbled
out--what went in a goliath wellnigh
some half of a david hobbled

sell the stag's head for a bracket
with its grand twelve tines--i'd buy it myself
and use the skin for a jacket

he was wiser, made both head and hide
his win-penny: hands and knees on
would manage to crawl--poor crab--by the roads
in the misty stalking season

and if he discovered a bothy like this
why, harvest was sure: folk listened
he told his tale to the lovers of sport
lips twitched, cheeks glowed, eyes glistened

and when he had come to the close, and spread
his spoils for the gazers' wonder
with "gentlemen, here's the skull of the stag
i was over, thank god, not under

the company broke out in applause
have a munch of grouse and a hunk of bread
and a tug, besides, at our tipple

and "there's my pay for your pluck!" cried this
cried that, while t'other--but he was drunk
hiccupped "a trump, a tory

i hope i gave twice as much as the rest
for, as homer would say, "within grate
though teeth kept tongue," my whole soul growled




when a man's busy, why, leisure
strikes him as wonderful pleasure
straightway he wants to be busy
here we've got peace; and aghast i'm
caught thinking war the true pastime
is there a reason in metre
give us your speech, master peter
i who, if mortal dare say so
ne'er am at a loss with my naso
men are the merest ixions
here the king whistled aloud, "let's
such are the sorrowful chances
if you talk fine to king francis

and so, to the courtyard proceeding
our company, francis was leading
increased by new followers tenfold
before he arrived at the penfold
lords, ladies, like clouds which bedizen
at sunset the western horizon
and sir de lorge pressed 'mid the foremost
with the dame he professed to adore most
oh, what a face! one by fits eyed
her, and the horrible pitside
for the penfold surrounded a hollow
which led where the eye scarce dared follow
and shelved to the chamber secluded
where bluebeard, the great lion, brooded
the king hailed his keeper, an arab
as glossy and black as a scarab
and bade him make sport and at once stir
up and out of his den the old monster
they opened a hole in the wire-work
across it, and dropped there a firework
and fled: one's heart's beating redoubled
a pause, while the pit's mouth was troubled
the blackness and silence so utter
by the firework's slow sparkling and sputter
then earth in a sudden contortion
gave out to our gaze her abortion
such a brute! were i friend clement marot
and whose faculties move in no small mist
when he versifies david the psalmist
i should study that brute to describe you

one's whole blood grew curdling and creepy
to see the black mane, vast and heapy
the tail in the air stiff and straining
the wide eyes, nor waxing nor waning
as over the barrier which bounded
his platform, and us who surrounded
the barrier, they reached and they rested
on space that might stand him in best stead
for who knew, he thought, what the amazement
the eruption of clatter and blaze meant
and if, in this minute of wonder
no outlet, 'mid lightning and thunder
lay broad, and, his shackles all shivered
the lion at last was delivered
ay, that was the open sky o'erhead
and you saw by the flash on his forehead
by the hope in those eyes wide and steady
he was leagues in the desert already
driving the flocks up the mountain
or catlike couched hard by the fountain
to waylay the date-gathering negress
so guarded he entrance or egress
and so can afford the confession
we exercise wholesome discretion
in keeping aloof from his threshold
once hold you, those jaws want no fresh hold
their first would too pleasantly purloin
the visitor's brisket or sirloin
but who's he would prove so foolhardy
not the best man of marignan, pardie

the sentence no sooner was uttered
than over the rails a glove fluttered
fell close to the lion, and rested
the dame 'twas, who flung it and jested
with life so, de lorge had been wooing
for months past; he sat there pursuing
his suit, weighing out with nonchalance
fine speeches like gold from a balance

sound the trumpet, no true knight's a tarrier
de lorge made one leap at the barrier
walked straight to the glove,--while the lion
ne'er moved, kept his far-reaching eye on
the palm-tree-edged desert-spring's sapphire
and the musky oiled skin of the kaffir
picked it up, and as calmly retreated
leaped back where the lady was seated
and full in the face of its owner
flung the glove

so should i!"--cried the king--"'twas mere vanity
not love, set that task to humanity
lords and ladies alike turned with loathing
from such a proved wolf in sheep's clothing

not so, i; for i caught an expression
in her brow's undisturbed self-possession
amid the court's scoffing and merriment
as if from no pleasing experiment
she rose, yet of pain not much heedful
so long as the process was needful
as if she had tried in a crucible
to what "speeches like gold" were reducible
and, finding the finest prove copper
felt the smoke in her face was but proper
to know what she had _not_ to trust to
was worth all the ashes and dust too
she went out 'mid hooting and laughter
clement marot stayed; i followed after
and asked, as a grace, what it all meant
if she wished not the rash deed's recallment
human nature,--behooves that i know it

she told me, "too long had i heard
of the deed proved alone by the word
for my love--what de lorge would not dare
with my scorn--what de lorge could compare
and the endless descriptions of death
he would brave when my lip formed a breath
i must reckon as braved, or, of course
doubt his word--and moreover, perforce
for such gifts as no lady could spurn
must offer my love in return
when i looked on your lion, it brought
all the dangers at once to my thought
encountered by all sorts of men
before he was lodged in his den
from the poor slave whose club or bare hands
dug the trap, set the snare on the sands
with no king and no court to applaud
by no shame, should he shrink, overawed
yet to capture the creature made shift
that his rude boys might laugh at the gift
of the pit, on no greater pretence
than to get back the bonnet he dropped
lest his pay for a week should be stopped
so, wiser i judged it to make
one trial what 'death for my sake
really meant, while the power was yet mine
than to wait until time should define
who took it to mean just 'to die
the blow a glove gives is but weak
does the mark yet discolour my cheek
but when the heart suffers a blow
will the pain pass so soon, do you know

i looked, as away she was sweeping
and saw a youth eagerly keeping
as close as he dared to the doorway
no doubt that a noble should more weigh
his life than befits a plebeian
and yet, had our brute been nemean
the youth stepped with, forward to serve her
if you whispered, "friend, what you'd get, first earn
and when, shortly after, she carried
her shame from the court, and they married
to that marriage some happiness, maugre
the voice of the court, i dared augur
