# Train your own poem generator model

There are notebooks of interest here:
 * A poem generator that generates text backwards (from the last letter to the first). The idea is to use it with a rhyme generator.
 * A rhyme generator that returns list of words that are supposed to rhyme
 
The first notebook relies on a corpus of poems named 'corpus.txt'

The second notebook will take 'rhymes.txt' as a database of rhymes.

Note that 'rhymes.txt' is nothing but the rhymes extracted from 'corpus.txt'.

(TO DO: upload corpus2rhyme)
