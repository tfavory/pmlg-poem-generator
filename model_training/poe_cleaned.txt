
once upon a midnight dreary  while i pondered  weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
while i nodded  nearly napping  suddenly there came a tapping
as of some one gently rapping  rapping at my chamber door
only this and nothing more

ah  distinctly i remember  it was in the bleak december
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
eagerly i wished the morrow   vainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow  sorrow for the lost lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
nameless here for evermore

and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled me  filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
so that now  to still the beating of my heart  i stood repeating
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
this it is and nothing more

presently my soul grew stronger  hesitating then no longer
but the fact is i was napping  and so gently you came rapping
and so faintly you came tapping  tapping at my chamber door
that i scarce was sure i heard you   here i opened wide the door
darkness there and nothing more

deep into that darkness peering  long i stood there wondering
fearing
doubting  dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
but the silence was unbroken  and the darkness gave no token
and the only word there spoken was the whispered word   lenore
this i whispered  and an echo murmured back the word   lenore
merely this and nothing more

back into the chamber turning  all my soul within me burning
soon i heard again a tapping  somewhat louder than before
let me see  then  what thereat is  and this mystery explore
let my heart be still a moment  and this mystery explore

open here i flung the shutter  when  with many a flirt and flutter
in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
not the least obeisance made he  not an instant stopped or stayed he
but  with mien of lord or lady  perched above my chamber door
perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door
perched  and sat  and nothing more

then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
craven
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore
tell me what thy lordly name is on the night s plutonian shore
quoth the raven   nevermore

much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
though its answer little meaning  little relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
with such name as  nevermore

but the raven  sitting lonely on that placid bust  spoke only
that one word  as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
nothing further then he uttered  not a feather then he fluttered
till i scarcely more than muttered   other friends have flown before
on the morrow  he  will leave me  as my hopes have flown before
then the bird said   nevermore

startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
till the dirges of his hope the melancholy burden bore
of  never  nevermore

but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling
straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and
then  upon the velvet sinking  i betook myself to linking
fancy unto fancy  thinking what this ominous bird of yore
what this grim  ungainly  ghastly  gaunt  and ominous bird of yore
meant in croaking  nevermore

this i sat engaged in guessing  but no syllable expressing
to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom s core
this and more i sat divining  with my head at ease reclining
on the cushion s velvet lining that the lamp light gloated o er
but whose velvet violet lining with the lamp light gloating o er

then  methought  the air grew denser  perfumed from an unseen censer
swung by seraphim whose foot falls tinkled on the tufted floor
sent thee
respite  respite aad nepenth  from thy memories of lenore
quaff  oh quaff this kind nepenth   and forget this lost lenore
quoth the raven   nevermore

whether tempter sent  or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
desolate yet all undaunted  on this desert land enchanted
on this home by horror haunted  tell me truly  i implore
is there   is  there balm in gilead   tell me  tell me  i implore
quoth the raven   nevermore

by that heaven that bends above us  by that god we both adore
tell this soul with sorrow laden if  within the distant aidenn
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
quoth the raven   nevermore

upstarting
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
leave my loneliness unbroken   quit the bust above my door
take thy beak from out my heart  and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven   nevermore

and the raven  never flitting  still is sitting  still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon s that is dreaming
and the lamp light o er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
shall be lifted  nevermore



hear the sledges with the bells
silver bells
what a world of merriment their melody foretells
how they tinkle  tinkle  tinkle
in their icy air of night
while the stars  that oversprinkle
all the heavens  seem to twinkle
with a crystalline delight
keeping time  time  time
in a sort of runic rhyme
to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
from the bells  bells  bells  bells
bells  bells  bells
from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells


hear the mellow wedding bells
golden bells
what a world of happiness their harmony foretells
through the balmy air of night
how they ring out their delight
from the molten golden notes
and all in tune
what a liquid ditty floats
to the turtle dove that listens  while she gloats
on the moon
oh  from out the sounding cells
what a gush of euphony voluminously wells
how it swells
how it dwells
on the future  how it tells
of the rapture that impels
to the swinging and the ringing
of the bells  bells  bells
of the bells  bells  bells  bells
bells  bells  bells
to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells


hear the loud alarum bells
brazen bells
what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells
in the startled ear of night
how they scream out their affright
too much horrified to speak
they can only shriek  shriek
out of tune
in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire
in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
leaping higher  higher  higher
with a desperate desire
and a resolute endeavor
now  now to sit or never
by the side of the pale faced moon
oh  the bells  bells  bells
what a tale their terror tells
of despair
how they clang  and clash  and roar
what a horror they outpour
on the bosom of the palpitating air
yet the ear it fully knows
by the twanging
and the clanging
how the danger ebbs and flows
yet the ear distinctly tells
in the jangling
and the wrangling
how the danger sinks and swells
by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells
of the bells
of the bells  bells  bells  bells
bells  bells  bells
in the clamor and the clangor of the bells


hear the tolling of the bells
iron bells
what a world of solemn thought their monody compels
in the silence of the night
how we shiver with affright
at the melancholy menace of their tone
for every sound that floats
from the rust within their throats
is a groan
and the people  ah  the people
they that dwell up in the steeple
all alone
and who toiling  toiling  toiling
in that muffled monotone
feel a glory in so rolling
on the human heart a stone
they are neither man nor woman
they are neither brute nor human
they are ghouls
and their king it is who tolls
and he rolls  rolls  rolls
rolls
a p an from the bells
and his merry bosom swells
with the p an of the bells
and he dances  and he yells
keeping time  time  time
in a sort of runic rhyme
to the p an of the bells
of the bells
keeping time  time  time
in a sort of runic rhyme
to the throbbing of the bells
of the bells  bells  bells
to the sobbing of the bells
keeping time  time  time
as he knells  knells  knells
in a happy runic rhyme
to the rolling of the bells
of the bells  bells  bells
to the tolling of the bells
of the bells  bells  bells  bells
bells  bells  bells
to the moaning and the groaning of the bells



the skies they were ashen and sober
the leaves they were crisped and sere
the leaves they were withering and sere
it was night in the lonesome october
of my most immemorial year
it was hard by the dim lake of auber
in the misty mid region of weir
it was down by the dank tarn of auber
in the ghoul haunted woodland of weir

here once  through an alley titanic
of cypress  i roamed with my soul
of cypress  with psyche  my soul
these were days when my heart was volcanic
as the scoriac rivers that roll
as the lavas that restlessly roll
their sulphurous currents down yaanek
in the ultimate climes of the pole
that groan as they roll down mount yaanek
in the realms of the boreal pole

our talk had been serious and sober
but our thoughts they were palsied and sere
our memories were treacherous and sere
for we knew not the month was october
and we marked not the night of the year
we noted not the dim lake of auber
remembered not the dank tarn of auber
nor the ghoul haunted woodland of weir

and now as the night was senescent
and star dials pointed to morn
as the sun dials hinted of morn
at the end of our path a liquescent
and nebulous lustre was born
out of which a miraculous crescent
arose with a duplicate horn
astarte s bediamonded crescent
distinct with its duplicate horn

and i said   she is warmer than dian
she rolls through an ether of sighs
she revels in a region of sighs
she has seen that the tears are not dry on
these cheeks  where the worm never dies
and has come past the stars of the lion
to point us the path to the skies
to the lethean peace of the skies
come up  in despite of the lion
to shine on us with her bright eyes
come up through the lair of the lion
with love in her luminous eyes

but psyche  uplifting her finger
said   sadly this star i mistrust
her pallor i strangely mistrust
oh  hasten   oh  let us not linger
oh  fly   let us fly   for we must
in terror she spoke  letting sink her
wings till they trailed in the dust
in agony sobbed  letting sink her
plumes till they trailed in the dust
till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust

i replied   this is nothing but dreaming
let us on by this tremulous light
let us bathe in this crystalline light
its sibyllic splendor is beaming
with hope and in beauty to night
see   it flickers up the sky through the night
ah  we safely may trust to its gleaming
and be sure it will lead us aright
we safely may trust to a gleaming
that cannot but guide us aright
since it flickers up to heaven through the night

thus i pacified psyche and kissed her
and tempted her out of her gloom
and conquered her scruples and gloom
and we passed to the end of a vista
but were stopped by the door of a tomb
by the door of a legended tomb
and i said   what is written  sweet sister
on the door of this legended tomb
she replied   ulalume  ulalume

then my heart it grew ashen and sober
as the leaves that were crisped and sere
as the leaves that were withering and sere
and i cried   it was surely october
on  this  very night of last year
that i journeyed  i journeyed down here
that i brought a dread burden down here
on this night of all nights in the year
ah  what demon has tempted me here
well i know  now  this dim lake of auber
this misty mid region of weir
well i know  now  this dank tarn of auber
this ghoul haunted woodland of weir



i saw thee once  once only  years ago
i must not say  how  many  but  not  many
it was a july midnight  and from out
a full orbed moon  that  like thine own soul  soaring
sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven
there fell a silvery silken veil of light
with quietude  and sultriness and slumber
upon the upturn d faces of a thousand
roses that grew in an enchanted garden
where no wind dared to stir  unless on tiptoe
fell on the upturn d faces of these roses
that gave out  in return for the love light
their odorous souls in an ecstatic death
fell on the upturn d faces of these roses
that smiled and died in this parterre  enchanted
by thee  and by the poetry of thy presence

clad all in white  upon a violet bank
i saw thee half reclining  while the moon
fell on the upturn d faces of the roses
and on thine own  upturn d  alas  in sorrow

was it not fate  that  on this july midnight
was it not fate  whose name is also sorrow
that bade me pause before that garden gate
to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses
no footstep stirred  the hated world all slept
save only thee and me   o heaven   o god
how my heart beats in coupling those two words
save only thee and me  i paused  i looked
and in an instant all things disappeared
the pearly lustre of the moon went out
the mossy banks and the meandering paths
the happy flowers and the repining trees
were seen no more  the very roses  odors
died in the arms of the adoring airs
all  all expired save thee  save less than thou
save only the divine light in thine eyes
save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes
i saw but them  they were the world to me
i saw but them  saw only them for hours
saw only them until the moon went down
what wild heart histories seemed to lie unwritten
upon those crystalline  celestial spheres
how dark a woe  yet how sublime a hope
how silently serene a sea of pride
how daring an ambition  yet how deep
how fathomless a capacity for love

but now  at length  dear dian sank from sight
into a western couch of thunder cloud
and thou  a ghost  amid the entombing trees
didst glide away   only thine eyes remained
they  would not  go  they never yet have gone
lighting my lonely pathway home that night
they follow me  they lead me through the years

they are my ministers  yet i their slave
their office is to illumine and enkindle
my duty   to be saved  by their bright light
and purified in their electric fire
and sanctified in their elysian fire
they fill my soul with beauty  which is hope
and are far up in heaven  the stars i kneel to
in the sad  silent watches of my night
while even in the meridian glare of day
i see them still  two sweetly scintillant
venuses  unextinguished by the sun



it was many and many a year ago
in a kingdom by the sea
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me

in this kingdom by the sea
but we loved with a love that was more than love
with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me

and this was the reason that  long ago
in this kingdom by the sea
a wind blew out of a cloud  chilling
so that her highborn kinsmen came
and bore her away from me
to shut her up in a sepulchre
in this kingdom by the sea

the angels  not half so happy in heaven
went envying her and me
yes   that was the reason  as all men know
in this kingdom by the sea
that the wind came out of the cloud by night

but our love it was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we
of many far wiser than we
and neither the angels in heaven above
nor the demons down under the sea
can ever dissever my soul from the soul

for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes
and so  all the night tide  i lie down by the side
of my darling  my darling  my life and my bride
in her sepulchre there by the sea
in her tomb by the side of the sea


for her this rhyme is penned  whose luminous eyes
brightly expressive as the twins of leda
shall find her own sweet name  that  nestling lies
upon the page  enwrapped from every reader
search narrowly the lines   they hold a treasure
divine  a talisman  an amulet
that must be worn  at heart   search well the measure
the words  the syllables  do not forget
the trivialest point  or you may lose your labor
and yet there is in this no gordian knot
which one might not undo without a sabre
if one could merely comprehend the plot
enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
eyes scintillating soul  there lie  perdus
three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
of poets by poets  as the name is a poet s  too
its letters  although naturally lying
like the knight pinto  mendez ferdinando
still form a synonym for truth  cease trying
you will not read the riddle  though you do the best you  can  do


through all the flimsy things we see at once
as easily as through a naples bonnet
trash of all trash   how  can  a lady don it
yet heavier far than your petrarchan stuff
owl downy nonsense that the faintest puff
twirls into trunk paper the while you con it
and  veritably  sol is right enough
the general tuckermanities are arrant
bubbles  ephemeral and  so  transparent
but  this is   now  you may depend upon it
stable  opaque  immortal  all by dint
of the dear names that lie concealed within t



because i feel that  in the heavens above
the angels  whispering to one another
can find  among their burning terms of love
none so devotional as that of  mother
therefore by that dear name i long have called you
you who are more than mother unto me
and fill my heart of hearts  where death installed you
in setting my virginia s spirit free
my mother  my own mother  who died early
was but the mother of myself  but you
are mother to the one i loved so dearly
and thus are dearer than the mother i knew
by that infinity with which my wife
was dearer to my soul than its soul life



thank heaven  the crisis
the danger is past
and the lingering illness
is over at last
and the fever called  living
is conquered at last

sadly  i know
i am shorn of my strength
and no muscle i move
as i lie at full length
but no matter   i feel
i am better at length

and i rest so composedly
now in my bed
that any beholder
might fancy me dead
might start at beholding me
thinking me dead

the moaning and groaning
the sighing and sobbing
are quieted now
with that horrible throbbing
at heart   ah  that horrible
horrible throbbing

the sickness  the nausea
the pitiless pain
have ceased  with the fever
that maddened my brain
with the fever called  living
that burned in my brain

and oh  of all tortures
has abated  the terrible
torture of thirst
for the naphthaline river
of passion accurst
i have drank of a water
that quenches all thirst

of a water that flows
with a lullaby sound
from a spring but a very few
feet under ground
from a cavern not very far
down under ground

and ah  let it never
be foolishly said
that my room it is gloomy
and narrow my bed
for man never slept
in a different bed
and  to  sleep   you must slumber
in just such a bed

my tantalized spirit
here blandly reposes
forgetting  or never
regretting its roses
its old agitations
of myrtles and roses

for now  while so quietly
lying  it fancies
a holier odor
about it  of pansies
a rosemary odor
commingled with pansies
with rue and the beautiful
puritan pansies

and so it lies happily
bathing in many
a dream of the truth
and the beauty of annie
drowned in a bath
of the tresses of annie

she tenderly kissed me
she fondly caressed
and then i fell gently
to sleep on her breast
deeply to sleep
from the heaven of her breast

when the light was extinguished
she covered me warm
and she prayed to the angels
to keep me from harm
to the queen of the angels
to shield me from harm

and i lie so composedly
now in my bed
that you fancy me dead
and i rest so contentedly
now in my bed
that you fancy me dead
that you shudder to look at me
thinking me dead

but my heart it is brighter
than all of the many
stars in the sky
for it sparkles with annie
it glows with the light
of the love of my annie
with the thought of the light
of the eyes of my annie



beloved  amid the earnest woes
that crowd around my earthly path
not even one lonely rose
my soul at least a solace hath
in dreams of thee  and therein knows
an eden of bland repose

and thus thy memory is to me
like some enchanted far off isle
in some tumultuous sea
some ocean throbbing far and free
with storm  but where meanwhile
serenest skies continually
just o er that one bright inland smile



thou wouldst be loved   then let thy heart
from its present pathway part not
being everything which now thou art
be nothing which thou art not
so with the world thy gentle ways
thy grace  thy more than beauty
shall be an endless theme of praise
and love a simple duty



gaily bedight
a gallant knight
in sunshine and in shadow
had journeyed long
singing a song
in search of eldorado
but he grew old
this knight so bold
and o er his heart a shadow
fell as he found
no spot of ground
that looked like eldorado

and  as his strength
failed him at length
he met a pilgrim shadow
this land of eldorado

of the moon
down the valley of the shadow
ride  boldly ride
the shade replied



i dwelt alone
in a world of moan
and my soul was a stagnant tide
till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride
till the yellow haired young eulalie became my smiling bride
ah  less  less bright
the stars of the night
than the eyes of the radiant girl
and never a flake
that the vapor can make
with the moon tints of purple and pearl
can vie with the modest eulalie s most unregarded curl
can compare with the bright eyed eulalie s most humble and careless
now doubt  now pain
come never again
for her soul gives me sigh for sigh
and all day long
shines  bright and strong
astart  within the sky
while ever to her dear eulalie upturns her matron eye
while ever to her young eulalie upturns her violet eye



take this kiss upon the brow
and  in parting from you now
thus much let me avow
you are not wrong  who deem
that my days have been a dream
yet if hope has flown away
in a night  or in a day
in a vision or in none
is it therefore the less  gone
is but a dream within a dream

i stand amid the roar
of a surf tormented shore
and i hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand
how few  yet how they creep
through my fingers to the deep
while i weep  while i weep
o god  can i not grasp
them with a tighter clasp
o god  can i not save
is  all  that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream



of all who hail thy presence as the morning
of all to whom thine absence is the night
the blotting utterly from out high heaven
the sacred sun  of all who  weeping  bless thee
hourly for hope  for life  ah  above all
for the resurrection of deep buried faith
in truth  in virtue  in humanity
of all who  on despair s unhallowed bed
lying down to die  have suddenly arisen
at thy soft murmured words   let there be light
at thy soft murmured words that were fulfilled
in thy seraphic glancing of thine eyes
of all who owe thee most  whose gratitude
nearest resembles worship   oh  remember
the truest  the most fervently devoted
and think that these weak lines are written by him
by him who  as he pens them  thrills to think
his spirit is communing with an angel s



not long ago  the writer of these lines
in the mad pride of intellectuality
maintained  the power of words   denied that ever
a thought arose within the human brain
beyond the utterance of the human tongue
and now  as if in mockery of that boast
two words  two foreign soft dissyllables
italian tones  made only to be murmured
by angels dreaming in the moonlit  dew
that hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill
have stirred from out the abysses of his heart
unthought like thoughts that are the souls of thought
richer  far wilder  far diviner visions
than even the seraph harper  israfel
could hope to utter  and i  my spells are broken
the pen falls powerless from my shivering hand
with thy dear name as text  though hidden by thee
i cannot write  i cannot speak or think
alas  i cannot feel  for  tis not feeling
this standing motionless upon the golden
threshold of the wide open gate of dreams
gazing  entranced  adown the gorgeous vista
and thrilling as i see  upon the right
upon the left  and all the way along
amid empurpled vapors  far away
to where the prospect terminates   thee only


lo  death has reared himself a throne
in a strange city lying alone
far down within the dim west
where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
have gone to their eternal rest
there shrines and palaces and towers
resemble nothing that is ours
around  by lifting winds forgot
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie

no rays from the holy heaven come down
on the long night time of that town
but light from out the lurid sea
streams up the turrets silently
gleams up the pinnacles far and free
up domes  up spires  up kingly halls
up fanes  up babylon like walls
up shadowy long forgotten bowers
of sculptured ivy and stone flowers
up many and many a marvellous shrine
whose wreathed friezes intertwine
the viol  the violet  and the vine

resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie
so blend the turrets and shadows there
that all seem pendulous in air
while from a proud tower in the town
death looks gigantically down

there open fanes and gaping graves
yawn level with the luminous waves
but not the riches there that lie
in each idol s diamond eye
not the gaily jewelled dead
tempt the waters from their bed
for no ripples curl  alas
along that wilderness of glass
no swellings tell that winds may be
upon some far off happier sea
no heavings hint that winds have been
on seas less hideously serene

but lo  a stir is in the air
the wave  there is a movement there
as if the towers had thrust aside
in slightly sinking  the dull tide
as if their tops had feebly given
a void within the filmy heaven
the waves have now a redder glow
the hours are breathing faint and low
and when  amid no earthly moans
down  down that town shall settle hence
hell  rising from a thousand thrones
shall do it reverence



at midnight  in the month of june
i stand beneath the mystic moon
an opiate vapor  dewy  dim
exhales from out her golden rim
and  softly dripping  drop by drop
upon the quiet mountain top
steals drowsily and musically
into the universal valley
the rosemary nods upon the grave
the lily lolls upon the wave
wrapping the fog about its breast
the ruin moulders into rest
looking like lethe  see  the lake
a conscious slumber seems to take
and would not  for the world  awake
all beauty sleeps   and lo  where lies
irene  with her destinies

oh  lady bright  can it be right
this window open to the night
the wanton airs  from the tree top
laughingly through the lattice drop
the bodiless airs  a wizard rout
flit through thy chamber in and out
and wave the curtain canopy
so fitfully  so fearfully
above the closed and fringed lid
that  o er the floor and down the wall
like ghosts the shadows rise and fall
oh  lady dear  hast thou no fear
why and what art thou dreaming here
sure thou art come o er far off seas
a wonder to these garden trees
strange is thy pallor  strange thy dress
strange  above all  thy length of tress
and this all solemn silentness

the lady sleeps  oh  may her sleep
which is enduring  so be deep
heaven have her in its sacred keep
this chamber changed for one more holy
this bed for one more melancholy
i pray to god that she may lie
for ever with unopened eye
while the dim sheeted ghosts go by

my love  she sleeps  oh  may her sleep
as it is lasting  so be deep
soft may the worms about her creep
far in the forest  dim and old
for her may some tall vault unfold
some vault that oft hath flung its black
and winged panels fluttering back
triumphant  o er the crested palls
of her grand family funerals
some sepulchre  remote  alone
against whose portal she hath thrown
in childhood many an idle stone
some tomb from out whose sounding door
she ne er shall force an echo more
thrilling to think  poor child of sin
it was the dead who groaned within



the ring is on my hand
and the wreath is on my brow
satins and jewels grand
are all at my command
and i am happy now

and my lord he loves me well
but  when first he breathed his vow
i felt my bosom swell
for the words rang as a knell
and the voice seemed  his  who fell
in the battle down the dell
and who is happy now

but he spoke to reassure me
and he kissed my pallid brow
while a reverie came o er me
and to the churchyard bore me
and i sighed to him before me
thinking him dead d elormie

and thus the words were spoken
and thus the plighted vow
and  though my faith be broken
and  though my heart be broken
behold the golden keys
that  proves  me happy now

would to god i could awaken
for i dream i know not how
and my soul is sorely shaken
lest an evil step be taken
lest the dead who is forsaken
may not be happy now



the bells   ah the bells
the little silver bells
how fairy like a melody there floats
from their throats
from their merry little throats
from the silver  tinkling throats
of the bells  bells  bells
of the bells


the bells   ah  the bells
the heavy iron bells
how horrible a monody there floats
from their throats
from their deep toned throats
from their melancholy throats
how i shudder at the notes
of the bells  bells  bells
of the bells


ah  broken is the golden bowl  the spirit flown forever
let the bell toll   a saintly soul floats on the stygian river
and  guy de vere  hast  thou  no tear   weep now or never more
see  on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love  lenore
come  let the burial rite be read  the funeral song be sung
an anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young
a dirge for her  the doubly dead in that she died so young

and when she fell in feeble health  ye blessed her  that she died
how  shall  the ritual  then  be read   the requiem how be sung
by you  by yours  the evil eye   by yours  the slanderous tongue
that did to death the innocence that died  and died so young

go up to god so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong
the sweet lenore hath  gone before   with hope  that flew beside
leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride
for her  the fair and  d bonnaire   that now so lowly lies
the life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes
the life still there  upon her hair  the death upon her eyes

but waft the angel on her flight with a p an of old days
let  no  bell toll   lest her sweet soul  amid its hallowed mirth
should catch the note  as it doth float up from the damned earth
to friends above  from fiends below  the indignant ghost is riven
from hell unto a high estate far up within the heaven
from grief and groan to a golden throne beside the king of heaven


thou wast that all to me  love
for which my soul did pine
a green isle in the sea  love
a fountain and a shrine
all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers
and all the flowers were mine

ah  dream too bright to last
ah  starry hope  that didst arise
but to be overcast
a voice from out the future cries
mute  motionless  aghast

for  alas  alas  with me
the light of life is o er
to the sands upon the shore
shall bloom the thunder blasted tree
or the stricken eagle soar

and all my days are trances
and all my nightly dreams
are where thy dark eye glances
and where thy footstep gleams
in what ethereal dances
by what eternal streams

alas  for that accursed time
they bore thee o er the billow
from love to titled age and crime
and an unholy pillow
from me  and from our misty clime
where weeps the silver willow


type of the antique rome  rich reliquary
of lofty contemplation left to time
by buried centuries of pomp and power
at length  at length  after so many days
of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst
i kneel  an altered and an humble man
amid thy shadows  and so drink within
my very soul thy grandeur  gloom  and glory

vastness  and age  and memories of eld
silence  and desolation  and dim night
i feel ye now  i feel ye in your strength
o spells more sure than e er jud an king
taught in the gardens of gethsemane
o charms more potent than the rapt chaldee
ever drew down from out the quiet stars

here  where a hero fell  a column falls
here  where the mimic eagle glared in gold
a midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat
here  where the dames of rome their gilded hair
waved to the wind  now wave the reed and thistle
here  where on golden throne the monarch lolled
glides  spectre like  unto his marble home
lit by the wan light of the horned moon
the swift and silent lizard of the stones

but stay  these walls  these ivy clad arcades
these mouldering plinths  these sad and blackened shafts
these vague entablatures  this crumbling frieze
these shattered cornices  this wreck  this ruin
these stones  alas  these gray stones  are they all
all of the famed  and the colossal left
by the corrosive hours to fate and me

prophetic sounds and loud  arise forever
from us  and from all ruin  unto the wise
as melody from memnon to the sun
we rule the hearts of mightiest men  we rule
with a despotic sway all giant minds
we are not impotent  we pallid stones
not all our power is gone  not all our fame
not all the magic of our high renown
not all the wonder that encircles us
not all the mysteries that in us lie
not all the memories that hang upon
and cling around about us as a garment
clothing us in a robe of more than glory


in the greenest of our valleys
by good angels tenanted
once a fair and stately palace
radiant palace  reared its head
in the monarch thought s dominion
it stood there
never seraph spread a pinion
over fabric half so fair

banners yellow  glorious  golden
on its roof did float and flow
time long ago
and every gentle air that dallied
in that sweet day
along the ramparts plumed and pallid
a winged odor went away

wanderers in that happy valley
through two luminous windows  saw
spirits moving musically
to a lute s well tun d law
bound about a throne where  sitting
in state his glory well befitting
the ruler of the realm was seen

and all with pearl and ruby glowing
was the fair palace door
through which came flowing  flowing  flowing
and sparkling evermore
a troop of echoes  whose sweet duty
was but to sing
in voices of surpassing beauty
the wit and wisdom of their king

but evil things  in robes of sorrow
assailed the monarch s high estate
shall dawn upon him desolate
and round about his home the glory
that blushed and bloomed
is but a dim remembered story
of the old time entombed

and travellers  now  within that valley
through the red litten windows see
vast forms  that move fantastically
to a discordant melody
while  like a ghastly rapid river
through the pale door
a hideous throng rush out forever
and laugh  but smile no more



lo   tis a gala night
within the lonesome latter years
an angel throng  bewinged  bedight
in veils  and drowned in tears
sit in a theatre  to see
a play of hopes and fears
while the orchestra breathes fitfully
the music of the spheres

mimes  in the form of god on high
mutter and mumble low
and hither and thither fly
mere puppets they  who come and go
at bidding of vast formless things
that shift the scenery to and fro
flapping from out their condor wings
invisible wo

that motley drama  oh  be sure
it shall not be forgot
with its phantom chased for evermore
by a crowd that seize it not
through a circle that ever returneth in
to the self same spot
and much of madness  and more of sin
and horror the soul of the plot

but see  amid the mimic rout
a crawling shape intrude
a blood red thing that writhes from out
the scenic solitude
it writhes   it writhes   with mortal pangs
the mimes become its food
and the angels sob at vermin fangs
in human gore imbued

out  out are the lights  out all
and  over each quivering form
the curtain  a funeral pall
comes down with the rush of a storm
and the angels  all pallid and wan
uprising  unveiling  affirm
that the play is the tragedy   man
and its hero the conqueror worm



there are some qualities  some incorporate things
that have a double life  which thus is made
a type of that twin entity which springs
from matter and light  evinced in solid and shade
there is a twofold  silence   sea and shore
body and soul  one dwells in lonely places
newly with grass o ergrown  some solemn graces
some human memories and tearful lore
render him terrorless  his name s  no more
he is the corporate silence  dread him not
no power hath he of evil in himself
but should some urgent fate  untimely lot
bring thee to meet his shadow  nameless elf
that haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
no foot of man   commend thyself to god


by a route obscure and lonely
haunted by ill angels only
on a black throne reigns upright
i have reached these lands but newly
from an ultimate dim thule
from a wild weird clime that lieth  sublime

bottomless vales and boundless floods
and chasms  and caves  and titan woods
with forms that no man can discover
for the dews that drip all over
mountains toppling evermore
into seas without a shore
seas that restlessly aspire
surging  unto skies of fire
lakes that endlessly outspread
their lone waters  lone and dead
their still waters  still and chilly
with the snows of the lolling lily

by the lakes that thus outspread
their lone waters  lone and dead
their sad waters  sad and chilly
with the snows of the lolling lily

by the mountains  near the river
murmuring lowly  murmuring ever
by the gray woods   by the swamp
where the toad and the newt encamp
by the dismal tarns and pools
where dwell the ghouls
by each spot the most unholy
in each nook most melancholy

there the traveller meets aghast
sheeted memories of the past
shrouded forms that start and sigh
as they pass the wanderer by
white robed forms of friends long given
in agony  to the earth  and heaven

for the heart whose woes are legion
for the spirit that walks in shadow
but the traveller  travelling through it
may not  dare not openly view it
never its mysteries are exposed
to the weak human eye unclosed
so wills its king  who hath forbid
the uplifting of the fringed lid
and thus the sad soul that here passes
beholds it but through darkened glasses

by a route obscure and lonely
haunted by ill angels only

on a black throne reigns upright
i have wandered home but newly
from this ultimate dim thule


fair isle  that from the fairest of all flowers
thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take
how many memories of what radiant hours
at sight of thee and thine at once awake
how many scenes of what departed bliss
how many thoughts of what entombed hopes
how many visions of a maiden that is
no more  no more upon thy verdant slopes

transforming all  thy charms shall please  no more
thy memory  no more   accursed ground
henceforward i hold thy flower enamelled shore
o hyacinthine isle  o purple zante


at morn  at noon  at twilight dim
maria  thou hast heard my hymn
in joy and wo  in good and ill
mother of god  be with me still
when the hours flew brightly by
and not a cloud obscured the sky
my soul  lest it should truant be
thy grace did guide to thine and thee
now  when storms of fate o ercast
darkly my present and my past
let my future radiant shine
with sweet hopes of thee and thine

and now she s at the pony s head
on that side now  and now on this
and  almost stifled with her bliss
a few sad tears does betty shed
she pats the pony  where or when
she knows not     happy betty foy
oh  johnny  never mind the doctor


i heard a voice  it said    drink  pretty creature  drink
and  looking o er the hedge  before me i espied
a snow white mountain lamb  with a maiden at its side
no other sheep was near  the lamb was all alone
and by a slender cord was tether d to a stone

indeed we will  mr  w  is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite
i love a sheep from the bottom of my heart

and to employ his own language  he has imprisoned his own conceptions by
the barrier he has erected against those of others  it is lamentable to
think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics  and  like the
nyctanthes  waste its perfume upon the night alone  in reading that
man s poetry  i tremble like one who stands upon a volcano  conscious
from the very darkness bursting from the crater  of the fire and the
light that are weltering below

appellations as the nine titled corcyra   give me   i demanded of a

its  immediate  object  pleasure  not truth  to romance  by having  for
its object  an  indefinite  instead of a  definite  pleasure  being a
poem only so far as this object is attained  romance presenting
perceptible images with definite  poetry with  in definite sensations
to which end music is an  essential   since the comprehension of sweet
sound is our most indefinite conception  music  when combined with a
pleasurable idea  is poetry  music  without the idea  is simply music
the idea  without the music  is prose  from its very definitiveness


perceive  for the metaphysical poets as poets  the most sovereign
contempt  that they have followers proves nothing

more followers than a thief to the gallows


science  true daughter of old time thou art
who alterest all things with thy peering eyes
why preyest thou thus upon the poet s heart
vulture  whose wings are dull realities
how should he love thee  or how deem thee wise
who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
to seek for treasure in the jewelled skies
albeit he soared with an undaunted wing
hast thou not dragged diana from her car
and driven the hamadryad from the wood
to seek a shelter in some happier star
hast thou not torn the naiad from her flood
the elfin from the green grass  and from me
the summer dream beneath the tamarind tree




o  nothing earthly save the ray
as in those gardens where the day
springs from the gems of circassy
o  nothing earthly save the thrill
of melody in woodland rill
or  music of the passion hearted
joy s voice so peacefully departed
that like the murmur in the shell
its echo dwelleth and will dwell
o  nothing of the dross of ours
yet all the beauty  all the flowers
that list our love  and deck our bowers
adorn yon world afar  afar
the wandering star

her world lay lolling on the golden air
near four bright suns  a temporary rest
an oasis in desert of the blest
away away   mid seas of rays that roll
empyrean splendor o er th  unchained soul
the soul that scarce  the billows are so dense
can struggle to its destin d eminence
to distant spheres  from time to time  she rode
and late to ours  the favour d one of god
but  now  the ruler of an anchor d realm
she throws aside the sceptre  leaves the helm
and  amid incense and high spiritual hymns
laves in quadruple light her angel limbs

now happiest  loveliest in yon lovely earth
whence sprang the  idea of beauty  into birth
like woman s hair  mid pearls  until  afar
it lit on hills achaian  and there dwelt
she look d into infinity  and knelt
rich clouds  for canopies  about her curled
fit emblems of the model of her world
seen but in beauty  not impeding sight
of other beauty glittering thro  the light
a wreath that twined each starry form around
and all the opal d air in color bound

all hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
of flowers  of lilies such as rear d the head
on the fair capo deucato      and sprang
so eagerly around about to hang
upon the flying footsteps of  deep pride
of her who lov d a mortal  and so died   
the sephalica  budding with young bees
uprear d its purple stem around her knees
and gemmy flower  of trebizond misnam d   
inmate of highest stars  where erst it sham d
all other loveliness  its honied dew
deliriously sweet  was dropp d from heaven
and fell on gardens of the unforgiven
in trebizond  and on a sunny flower
so like its own above that  to this hour
it still remaineth  torturing the bee
with madness  and unwonted reverie
in heaven  and all its environs  the leaf
and blossom of the fairy plant  in grief
disconsolate linger  grief that hangs her head
repenting follies that full long have fled
heaving her white breast to the balmy air
like guilty beauty  chasten d  and more fair
nyctanthes too  as sacred as the light
she fears to perfume  perfuming the night
and clytia     pondering between many a sun
while pettish tears adown her petals run
and that aspiring flower that sprang on earth   
and died  ere scarce exalted into birth
bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
its way to heaven  from garden of a king
and valisnerian lotus thither flown   
from struggling with the waters of the rhone
and thy most lovely purple perfume  zante   
isola d oro   fior di levante
and the nelumbo bud that floats for ever   
with indian cupid down the holy river
fair flowers  and fairy  to whose care is given
to bear the goddess  song  in odors  up to heaven    

in the deep sky
the terrible and fair
in beauty vie
beyond the line of blue
the boundary of the star
which turneth at the view
of thy barrier and thy bar
of the barrier overgone
by the comets who were cast
from their pride  and from their throne
to be drudges till the last
to be carriers of fire
with speed that may not tire
and with pain that shall not part
who livest   that  we know
in eternity  we feel
but the shadow of whose brow
what spirit shall reveal
tho  the beings whom thy nesace
thy messenger hath known
have dream d for thy infinity
a model of their own    
thy will is done  o god
the star hath ridden high
thro  many a tempest  but she rode
beneath thy burning eye
and here  in thought  to thee
in thought that can alone
ascend thy empire and so be
a partner of thy throne
by winged fantasy    
my embassy is given
till secrecy shall knowledge be
in the environs of heaven

she ceas d  and buried then her burning cheek
abash d  amid the lilies there  to seek
a shelter from the fervor of his eye
for the stars trembled at the deity
she stirr d not  breath d not  for a voice was there
how solemnly pervading the calm air
a sound of silence on the startled ear
which dreamy poets name  the music of the sphere
ours is a world of words  quiet we call

all nature speaks  and ev n ideal things
flap shadowy sounds from the visionary wings
but ah  not so when  thus  in realms on high
the eternal voice of god is passing by
and the red winds are withering in the sky
link d to a little system  and one sun
where all my love is folly  and the crowd
still think my terrors but the thunder cloud
the storm  the earthquake  and the ocean wrath
what tho  in worlds which own a single sun
the sands of time grow dimmer as they run
yet thine is my resplendency  so given
to bear my secrets thro  the upper heaven
leave tenantless thy crystal home  and fly
with all thy train  athwart the moony sky
apart  like fire flies in sicilian night    
and wing to other worlds another light
divulge the secrets of thy embassy
to the proud orbs that twinkle  and so be
to ev ry heart a barrier and a ban
lest the stars totter in the guilt of man

up rose the maiden in the yellow night
the single mooned eve  on earth we plight
our faith to one love  and one moon adore
the birth place of young beauty had no more
as sprang that yellow star from downy hours
up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers
and bent o er sheeny mountain and dim plain
her way  but left not yet her theras an reign    


high on a mountain of enamell d head
such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
of giant pasturage lying at his ease
raising his heavy eyelid  starts and sees
with many a mutter d  hope to be forgiven
what time the moon is quadrated in heaven
of rosy head  that towering far away
into the sunlit ether  caught the ray
of sunken suns at eve  at noon of night
while the moon danc d with the fair stranger light
uprear d upon such height arose a pile
of gorgeous columns on th  uuburthen d air
flashing from parian marble that twin smile
far down upon the wave that sparkled there
and nursled the young mountain in its lair
of molten stars their pavement  such as fall    
thro  the ebon air  besilvering the pall
of their own dissolution  while they die
adorning then the dwellings of the sky
a dome  by linked light from heaven let down
sat gently on these columns as a crown
a window of one circular diamond  there
look d out above into the purple air
and rays from god shot down that meteor chain
and hallow d all the beauty twice again
save when  between th  empyrean and that ring
some eager spirit flapp d his dusky wing
but on the pillars seraph eyes have seen
the dimness of this world  that grayish green
that nature loves the best for beauty s grave
lurk d in each cornice  round each architrave
and every sculptured cherub thereabout
that from his marble dwelling peered out
seem d earthly in the shadow of his niche
achaian statues in a world so rich
friezes from tadmor and persepolis    
from balbec  and the stilly  clear abyss
of beautiful gomorrah  oh  the wave    
is now upon thee  but too late to save
sound loves to revel in a summer night
witness the murmur of the gray twilight
that stole upon the ear  in eyraco    
of many a wild star gazer long ago
that stealeth ever on the ear of him
who  musing  gazeth on the distance dim
and sees the darkness coming as a cloud
is not its form  its voice  most palpable and loud      
but what is this   it cometh  and it brings
a music with it   tis the rush of wings
a pause  and then a sweeping  falling strain
and nesace is in her halls again
from the wild energy of wanton haste
her cheeks were flushing  and her lips apart
the zone that clung around her gentle waist
had burst beneath the heaving of her heart
within the centre of that hall to breathe
she paus d and panted  zanthe  all beneath
the fairy light that kiss d her golden hair
and long d to rest  yet could but sparkle there

young flowers were whispering in melody    
to happy flowers that night  and tree to tree
fountains were gushing music as they fell
in many a star lit grove  or moon light dell
yet silence came upon material things
fair flowers  bright waterfalls and angel wings
and sound alone that from the spirit sprang
bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang

or tufted wild spray
that keeps  from the dreamer
the moonbeam away     
bright beings  that ponder
with half closing eyes
on the stars which your wonder
hath drawn from the skies
till they glance thro  the shade  and
come down to your brow
like  eyes of the maiden
who calls on you now
arise  from your dreaming
in violet bowers
to duty beseeming
these star litten hours
and shake from your tresses
encumber d with dew

the breath of those kisses
that cumber them too
could angels be blest
those kisses of true love
that lull d ye to rest
up  shake from your wing
each hindering thing
the dew of the night
it would weigh down your flight
and true love caresses
o  leave them apart
they are light on the tresses
but lead on the heart

ligeia  ligeia
my beautiful one
whose harshest idea
will to melody run
o  is it thy will
on the breezes to toss
or  capriciously still
like the lone albatross     
incumbent on night
to keep watch with delight
on the harmony there

ligeia  wherever
thy image may be
no magic shall sever
thy music from thee
thou hast bound many eyes
in a dreamy sleep
but the strains still arise
which  thy  vigilance keep

the sound of the rain
which leaps down to the flower
and dances again
in the rhythm of the shower
the murmur that springs    
from the growing of grass
are the music of things
but are modell d  alas
away  then  my dearest
o  hie thee away
to springs that lie clearest
beneath the moon ray
to lone lake that smiles
in its dream of deep rest
at the many star isles
that enjewel its breast
where wild flowers  creeping
have mingled their shade
on its margin is sleeping
full many a maid
some have left the cool glade  and
have slept with the bee     
arouse them  my maiden
on moorland and lea

go  breathe on their slumber
all softly in ear
the musical number
they slumber d to hear
for what can awaken
an angel so soon
whose sleep hath been taken
beneath the cold moon
as the spell which no slumber
of witchery may test
the rhythmical number
which lull d him to rest

spirits in wing  and angels to the view
a thousand seraphs burst th  empyrean thro
young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight
seraphs in all but  knowledge   the keen light
that fell  refracted  thro  thy bounds afar
o death  from eye of god upon that star
sweet was that error  sweeter still that death
sweet was that error  ev n with  us  the breath
of science dims the mirror of our joy
to them  twere the simoom  and would destroy
for what  to them  availeth it to know
that truth is falsehood  or that bliss is woe
sweet was their death  with them to die was rife
with the last ecstasy of satiate life
beyond that death no immortality
but sleep that pondereth and is not  to be
and there  oh  may my weary spirit dwell
apart from heaven s eternity  and yet how far from hell     

what guilty spirit  in what shrubbery dim
heard not the stirring summons of that hymn
but two  they fell  for heaven no grace imparts
to those who hear not for their beating hearts
a maiden angel and her seraph lover
o  where  and ye may seek the wide skies over
was love  the blind  near sober duty known
unguided love hath fallen   mid  tears of perfect moan      

he was a goodly spirit  he who fell
a wanderer by mossy mantled well
a gazer on the lights that shine above
a dreamer in the moonbeam by his love
what wonder  for each star is eye like there
and looks so sweetly down on beauty s hair
and they  and ev ry mossy spring were holy
to his love haunted heart and melancholy
the night had found  to him a night of wo
upon a mountain crag  young angelo
beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky
and scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie
here sate he with his love  his dark eye bent
with eagle gaze along the firmament
now turn d it upon her  but ever then
it trembled to the orb of earth again

how lovely  tis to look so far away
she seemed not thus upon that autumn eve
i left her gorgeous halls  nor mourned to leave
that eve  that eve  i should remember well
the sun ray dropped  in lemnos with a spell
on th  arabesque carving of a gilded hall
wherein i sate  and on the draperied wall
and on my eyelids  o  the heavy light
how drowsily it weighed them into night
on flowers  before  and mist  and love they ran
with persian saadi in his gulistan
but o  that light   i slumbered  death  the while
stole o er my senses in that lovely isle
so softly that no single silken hair
awoke that slept  or knew that he was there

was a proud temple called the parthenon     
more beauty clung around her columned wall
then even thy glowing bosom beats withal     
and when old time my wing did disenthral
thence sprang i  as the eagle from his tower
and years i left behind me in an hour
what time upon her airy bounds i hung
one half the garden of her globe was flung
unrolling as a chart unto my view
tenantless cities of the desert too
ianthe  beauty crowded on me then
and half i wished to be again of men

a brighter dwelling place is here for thee
and greener fields than in yon world above
and woman s loveliness  and passionate love
failed  as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft     
perhaps my brain grew dizzy  but the world
i left so late was into chaos hurled
sprang from her station  on the winds apart
and rolled a flame  the fiery heaven athwart
methought  my sweet one  then i ceased to soar
and fell  not swiftly as i rose before
but with a downward  tremulous motion thro
light  brazen rays  this golden star unto
nor long the measure of my falling hours
for nearest of all stars was thine to ours
dread star  that came  amid a night of mirth
a red daedalion on the timid earth

be given our lady s bidding to discuss
we came  my love  around  above  below
gay fire fly of the night we come and go
nor ask a reason save the angel nod
but  angelo  than thine gray time unfurled
never his fairy wing o er fairer world
dim was its little disk  and angel eyes
alone could see the phantom in the skies
when first al aaraaf knew her course to be
headlong thitherward o er the starry sea
but when its glory swelled upon the sky
as glowing beauty s bust beneath man s eye
we paused before the heritage of men
and thy star trembled  as doth beauty then

thus in discourse  the lovers whiled away
the night that waned and waned and brought no day
they fell  for heaven to them no hope imparts
who hear not for the beating of their hearts



kind solace in a dying hour
such  father  is not  now  my theme
i will not madly deem that power
of earth may shrive me of the sin
unearthly pride hath revelled in
i have no time to dote or dream
you call it hope  that fire of fire
it is but agony of desire
if i  can  hope  o god  i can
its fount is holier  more divine
i would not call thee fool  old man
but such is not a gift of thine

know thou the secret of a spirit
bowed from its wild pride into shame
o yearning heart  i did inherit
thy withering portion with the fame
the searing glory which hath shone
amid the jewels of my throne
halo of hell  and with a pain
not hell shall make me fear again
o craving heart  for the lost flowers
and sunshine of my summer hours
the undying voice of that dead time
with its interminable chime
rings  in the spirit of a spell
upon thy emptiness  a knell

i have not always been as now
the fevered diadem on my brow
i claimed and won usurpingly
hath not the same fierce heirdom given
rome to the c sar  this to me
the heritage of a kingly mind
and a proud spirit which hath striven
triumphantly with human kind
on mountain soil i first drew life
the mists of the taglay have shed
nightly their dews upon my head
and  i believe  the winged strife
and tumult of the headlong air
have nestled in my very hair

so late from heaven  that dew  it fell
upon me with the touch of hell
while the red flashing of the light
from clouds that hung  like banners  o er
appeared to my half closing eye
the pageantry of monarchy
and the deep trumpet thunder s roar
came hurriedly upon me  telling
of human battle  where my voice
my own voice  silly child   was swelling
and leap within me at the cry
the battle cry of victory

the rain came down upon my head
unsheltered  and the heavy wind
rendered me mad and deaf and blind
it was but man  i thought  who shed
laurels upon me  and the rush
the torrent of the chilly air
gurgled within my ear the crush
of empires  with the captive s prayer
the hum of suitors  and the tone
of flattery  round a sovereign s throne

my passions  from that hapless hour
usurped a tyranny which men
have deemed since i have reached to power
my innate nature  be it so
but  father  there lived one who  then
then  in my boyhood  when their fire
burned with a still intenser glow
e en  then  who knew this iron heart
in woman s weakness had a part

i have no words  alas   to tell
the loveliness of loving well
nor would i now attempt to trace
the more than beauty of a face
whose lineaments  upon my mind
are  shadows on th  unstable wind
thus i remember having dwelt
some page of early lore upon
with loitering eye  till i have felt
the letters  with their meaning  melt
to fantasies  with none

o  she was worthy of all love
love as in infancy was mine
might envy  her young heart the shrine
on which my every hope and thought
were incense  then a goodly gift
for they were childish and upright
pure  as her young example taught
why did i leave it  and  adrift
trust to the fire within  for light

we grew in age  and love  together
roaming the forest  and the wild
my breast her shield in wintry weather
and  when the friendly sunshine smiled
and she would mark the opening skies
young love s first lesson is    the heart
for  mid that sunshine  and those smiles
when  from our little cares apart
and laughing at her girlish wiles
i d throw me on her throbbing breast
and pour my spirit out in tears
there was no need to speak the rest
no need to quiet any fears
of her  who asked no reason why
but turned on me her quiet eye

yet  more  than worthy of the love
my spirit struggled with  and strove
when  on the mountain peak  alone
ambition lent it a new tone
i had no being  but in thee
the world  and all it did contain
in the earth  the air  the sea
its joy  its little lot of pain
that was new pleasure  the ideal
dim  vanities of dreams by night
and dimmer nothings which were real
parted upon their misty wings
and  so  confusedly  became
thine image and  a name  a name
two separate  yet most intimate things

i was ambitious  have you known
the passion  father  you have not
a cottager  i marked a throne
of half the world as all my own
and murmured at such lowly lot
but  just like any other dream
upon the vapor of the dew
my own had past  did not the beam
of beauty which did while it thro
the minute  the hour  the day  oppress
my mind with double loveliness

we walked together on the crown
of a high mountain which looked down
afar from its proud natural towers
of rock and forest  on the hills
the dwindled hills  begirt with bowers
and shouting with a thousand rills

i spoke to her of power and pride
but mystically  in such guise
that she might deem it nought beside
the moment s converse  in her eyes
i read  perhaps too carelessly
a mingled feeling with my own
the flush on her bright cheek  to me
seemed to become a queenly throne
too well that i should let it be
light in the wilderness alone

i wrapped myself in grandeur then
and donned a visionary crown
yet it was not that fantasy
had thrown her mantle over me
but that  among the rabble  men
lion ambition is chained down
and crouches to a keeper s hand
not so in deserts where the grand
the wild  the terrible conspire
with their own breath to fan his fire

look  round thee now on samarcand
is she not queen of earth  her pride
above all cities  in her hand
their destinies  in all beside
of glory which the world hath known
stands she not nobly and alone
falling  her veriest stepping stone
shall form the pedestal of a throne
and who her sovereign  timour  he
whom the astonished people saw
striding o er empires haughtily
a diademed outlaw

o  human love  thou spirit given
on earth  of all we hope in heaven
which fall st into the soul like rain
upon the siroc withered plain
and  failing in thy power to bless
but leav st the heart a wilderness
idea  which bindest life around
with music of so strange a sound
and beauty of so wild a birth
farewell  for i have won the earth

when hope  the eagle that towered  could see
no cliff beyond him in the sky
his pinions were bent droopingly
and homeward turned his softened eye
there comes a sullenness of heart
to him who still would look upon
the glory of the summer sun
that soul will hate the ev ning mist
so often lovely  and will list
to the sound of the coming darkness  known
to those whose spirits hearken  as one
who  in a dream of night   would  fly
but  cannot   from a danger nigh

what tho  the moon  tho  the white moon
shed all the splendor of her noon
in that time of dreariness  will seem
a portrait taken after death
and boyhood is a summer sun
whose waning is the dreariest one
for all we live to know is known
and all we seek to keep hath flown
let life  then  as the day flower  fall
with the noon day beauty  which is all
i reached my home  my home no more
for all had flown who made it so
i passed from out its mossy door
and  tho  my tread was soft and low
a voice came from the threshold stone
of one whom i had earlier known
o  i defy thee  hell  to show
on beds of fire that burn below
an humbler heart  a deeper woe

father  i firmly do believe
i  know   for death who comes for me
from regions of the blest afar
where there is nothing to deceive
hath left his iron gate ajar
and rays of truth you cannot see
are flashing thro  eternity
i do believe that eblis hath
a snare in every human path
else how  when in the holy grove
i wandered of the idol  love
who daily scents his snowy wings
with incense of burnt offerings
from the most unpolluted things
whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
above with trellised rays from heaven
no mote may shun  no tiniest fly
the light ning of his eagle eye
how was it that ambition crept
unseen  amid the revels there
till growing bold  he laughed and leapt
in the tangles of love s very hair


helen  thy beauty is to me
like those nicean barks of yore
that gently  o er a perfumed sea
the weary  wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore

on desperate seas long wont to roam
thy hyacinth hair  thy classic face
thy naiad airs have brought me home
to the glory that was greece
to the grandeur that was rome

lo  in yon brilliant window niche
how statue like i see thee stand
the agate lamp within thy hand
ah  psyche  from the regions which
are holy land


where the people did not dwell
they had gone unto the wars
trusting to the mild eyed stars
nightly  from their azure towers
to keep watch above the flowers
in the midst of which all day
the red sun light lazily lay
the sad valley s restlessness
nothing there is motionless
nothing save the airs that brood
over the magic solitude
ah  by no wind are stirred those trees
that palpitate like the chill seas
around the misty hebrides
ah  by no wind those clouds are driven
that rustle through the unquiet heaven
unceasingly  from morn till even
over the violets there that lie
in myriad types of the human eye
over the lilies that wave
and weep above a nameless grave
they wave   from out their fragrant tops
eternal dews come down in drops
they weep   from off their delicate stems
perennial tears descend in gems


in heaven a spirit doth dwell
none sing so wildly well
as the angel israfel
and the giddy stars  so legends tell
ceasing their hymns  attend the spell
of his voice  all mute

tottering above
in her highest noon
the enamoured moon
blushes with love
while  to listen  the red levin
which were seven
pauses in heaven

and they say  the starry choir
and the other listening things
that israfeli s fire
is owing to that lyre
by which he sits and sings
the trembling living wire
of those unusual strings

but the skies that angel trod
where deep thoughts are a duty
where love s a grow up god
where the houri glances are
imbued with all the beauty
which we worship in a star

therefore  thou art not wrong
israfeli  who despisest
an unimpassioned song
to thee the laurels belong
best bard  because the wisest
merrily live and long

the ecstasies above
with thy burning measures suit
thy grief  thy joy  thy hate  thy love
with the fervor of thy lute
well may the stars be mute

yes  heaven is thine  but this
is a world of sweets and sours
our flowers are merely  flowers
and the shadow of thy perfect bliss
is the sunshine of ours

if i could dwell
where israfel
he might not sing so wildly well
a mortal melody
while a bolder note than this might swell
from my lyre within the sky


i heed not that my earthly lot
hath  little of earth in it
that years of love have been forgot
in the hatred of a minute
i mourn not that the desolate
but that  you  sorrow for  my  fate
who am a passer by


the bowers whereat  in dreams  i see
the wantonest singing birds

are lips  and all thy melody
of lip begotten words

thine eyes  in heaven of heart enshrined
then desolately fall
o god  on my funereal mind
like starlight on a pall

thy heart   thy  heart   i wake and sigh
and sleep to dream till day
of the truth that gold can never buy
of the baubles that it may


fair river  in thy bright  clear flow
of crystal  wandering water
thou art an emblem of the glow
of beauty  the unhidden heart
the playful maziness of art
in old alberto s daughter

but when within thy wave she looks
which glistens then  and trembles
why  then  the prettiest of brooks
her worshipper resembles
for in his heart  as in thy stream
her image deeply lies
his heart which trembles at the beam
of her soul searching eyes


i saw thee on thy bridal day
when a burning blush came o er thee
though happiness around thee lay
the world all love before thee

and in thine eye a kindling light
was all on earth my aching sight
of loveliness could see

that blush  perhaps  was maiden shame
as such it well may pass
though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
in the breast of him  alas

who saw thee on that bridal day
when that deep blush  would  come o er thee
though happiness around thee lay
the world all love before thee


thy soul shall find itself alone
not one  of all the crowd  to pry
into thine hour of secrecy
be silent in that solitude
which is not loneliness  for then
the spirits of the dead who stood
in life before thee are again
in death around thee  and their will
shall overshadow thee  be still
the night  tho  clear  shall frown
and the stars shall not look down
from their high thrones in the heaven
with light like hope to mortals given
but their red orbs  without beam
to thy weariness shall seem
as a burning and a fever
which would cling to thee forever
now are thoughts thou shalt not banish
now are visions ne er to vanish
from thy spirit shall they pass
no more  like dew drops from the grass
the breeze  the breath of god  is still
and the mist upon the hill
shadowy  shadowy  yet unbroken
is a symbol and a token
how it hangs upon the trees
a mystery of mysteries


in visions of the dark night
i have dreamed of joy departed
but a waking dream of life and light
hath left me broken hearted

ah  what is not a dream by day
to him whose eyes are cast
on things around him with a ray
turned back upon the past

that holy dream  that holy dream
while all the world were chiding
hath cheered me as a lovely beam
a lonely spirit guiding

what though that light  thro  storm and night
so trembled from afar
what could there be more purely bright
in truth s day star


romance  who loves to nod and sing
with drowsy head and folded wing
among the green leaves as they shake
far down within some shadowy lake
to me a painted paroquet
hath been  a most familiar bird
taught me my alphabet to say
to lisp my very earliest word
while in the wild wood i did lie
a child  with a most knowing eye

of late  eternal condor years
so shake the very heaven on high
with tumult as they thunder by
i have no time for idle cares
though gazing on the unquiet sky
and when an hour with calmer wings
its down upon my spirit flings
that little time with lyre and rhyme
to while away  forbidden things
my heart would feel to be a crime
unless it trembled with the strings


dim vales  and shadowy floods
and cloudy looking woods
whose forms we can t discover
for the tears that drip all over
huge moons there wax and wane
again  again  again
every moment of the night
forever changing places
and they put out the star light
with the breath from their pale faces
about twelve by the moon dial
one more filmy than the rest
they have found to be the best
comes down  still down  and down
with its centre on the crown
of a mountain s eminence
while its wide circumference
in easy drapery falls
over hamlets  over halls
wherever they may be
o er the strange woods  o er the sea
over spirits on the wing
over every drowsy thing
and buries them up quite
in a labyrinth of light
and then  how deep   o  deep
is the passion of their sleep
in the morning they arise
and their moony covering
is soaring in the skies
with the tempests as they toss
like  almost any thing
or a yellow albatross
they use that moon no more
for the same end as before
videlicet a tent
which i think extravagant
its atomies  however
into a shower dissever
of which those butterflies
of earth  who seek the skies
and so come down again
have brought a specimen
upon their quivering wings


in spring of youth it was my lot
to haunt of the wide world a spot
the which i could not love the less
so lovely was the loneliness
of a wild lake  with black rock bound
and the tall pines that towered around

but when the night had thrown her pall
upon the spot  as upon all
and the mystic wind went by
murmuring in melody
then  ah  then  i would awake
to the terror of the lone lake

yet that terror was not fright
but a tremulous delight
a feeling not the jewelled mine
could teach or bribe me to define
nor love  although the love were thine

death was in that poisonous wave
and in its gulf a fitting grave
for him who thence could solace bring
to his lone imagining
whose solitary soul could make
an eden of that dim lake


and midtime of night
and stars  in their orbits
shone pale  through the light
of the brighter  cold moon
herself in the heavens
her beam on the waves

i gazed awhile
on her cold smile
too cold  too cold for me
there passed  as a shroud
a fleecy cloud
and i turned away to thee
proud evening star
in thy glory afar
and dearer thy beam shall be
for joy to my heart
is the proud part
thou bearest in heaven at night
and more i admire
thy distant fire
than that colder  lowly light


a dark unfathomed tide
of interminable pride
a mystery  and a dream
should my early life seem
i say that dream was fraught
with a wild and waking thought
of beings that have been
which my spirit hath not seen
had i let them pass me by
with a dreaming eye
let none of earth inherit
that vision on my spirit
those thoughts i would control
as a spell upon his soul
for that bright hope at last
and that light time have past
and my wordly rest hath gone
with a sigh as it passed on
i care not though it perish
with a thought i then did cherish


the happiest day  the happiest hour
my seared and blighted heart hath known
the highest hope of pride and power
i feel hath flown

of power  said i  yes  such i ween
but they have vanished long  alas
the visions of my youth have been
but let them pass

and pride  what have i now with thee
another brow may ev n inherit
the venom thou hast poured on me
be still my spirit

iv       the happiest day  the happiest hour
mine eyes shall see  have ever seen
the brightest glance of pride and power
i feel have been

v        but were that hope of pride and power
now offered with the pain
ev n  then  i felt  that brightest hour
i would not live again

vi       for on its wing was dark alloy
and as it fluttered  fell
an essence  powerful to destroy
a soul that knew it well


wreathed in myrtle  my sword i ll conceal
like those champions devoted and brave
when they plunged in the tyrant their steel
and to athens deliverance gave

beloved heroes  your deathless souls roam
in the joy breathing isles of the blest
where the mighty of old have their home
where achilles and diomed rest
in fresh myrtle my blade i ll entwine
like harmodius  the gallant and good
when he made at the tutelar shrine
a libation of tyranny s blood

ye deliverers of athens from shame
ye avengers of liberty s wrongs
endless ages shall cherish your fame
embalmed in their echoing songs


oh  that my young life were a lasting dream
my spirit not awakening  till the beam
of an eternity should bring the morrow
yes  though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow
of waking life  to him whose heart must be
and hath been still  upon the lovely earth
a chaos of deep passion  from his birth
but should it be  that dream eternally
continuing  as dreams have been to me
in my young boyhood  should it thus be given
for i have revelled when the sun was bright
i  the summer sky  in dreams of living light
and loveliness   have left my very heart
inclines of my imaginary apart   
from mine own home  with beings that have been
of mine own thought  what more could i have seen
from my remembrance shall not pass  some power
or spell had bound me   twas the chilly wind
came o er me in the night  and left behind
its image on my spirit  or the moon
shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
too coldly  or the stars  howe er it was
that dream was that that night wind  let it pass
i have been happy  and i love the theme
dreams  in their vivid coloring of life
as in that fleeting  shadowy  misty strife
of semblance with reality which brings
to the delirious eye  more lovely things
of paradise and love  and all my own
than young hope in his sunniest hour hath known


admiring nature s universal throne
her woods  her wilds  her mountains  the intense
reply of hers to our intelligence

in youth i have known one with whom the earth
in secret communing held  as he with it
in daylight  and in beauty  from his birth
whose fervid  flickering torch of life was lit
from the sun and stars  whence he had drawn forth
a passionate light such for his spirit was fit
and yet that spirit knew  not in the hour
of its own fervor  what had o er it power

perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
to a ferver     by the moonbeam that hangs o er
but i will half believe that wild light fraught
with more of sovereignty than ancient lore
hath ever told  or is it of a thought
the unembodied essence  and no more
that with a quickening spell doth o er us pass
as dew of the night time  o er the summer grass

doth o er us pass  when  as th  expanding eye
to the loved object  so the tear to the lid
will start  which lately slept in apathy
and yet it need not be   that object  hid
from us in life  but common  which doth lie
each hour before us  but then only bid
with a strange sound  as of a harp string broken
t  awake us   tis a symbol and a token

of what in other worlds shall be  and given
in beauty by our god  to those alone
who otherwise would fall from life and heaven
drawn by their heart s passion  and that tone
that high tone of the spirit which hath striven
though not with faith  with godliness  whose throne
with desperate energy  t hath beaten down
wearing its own deep feeling as a crown

how shall the burial rite be read
the solemn song be sung
the requiem for the loveliest dead
that ever died so young

her friends are gazing on her
and on her gaudy bier
and weep   oh  to dishonor
dead beauty with a tear

they loved her for her wealth
and they hated her for her pride
but she grew in feeble health
and they  love  her  that she died

they tell me  while they speak
of her  costly broider d pall
that my voice is growing weak
that i should not sing at all

or that my tone should be
tun d to such solemn song
so mournfully  so mournfully
that the dead may feel no wrong

but she is gone above
with young hope at her side
and i am drunk with love
of the dead  who is my bride

of the dead  dead who lies
all perfum d there
with the death upon her eyes
and the life upon her hair

thus on the coffin loud and long
i strike  the murmur sent
through the gray chambers to my song
shall be the accompaniment

thou diedst in thy life s june
but thou didst not die too fair
thou didst not die too soon
nor with too calm an air

from more than friends on earth
thy life and love are riven
to join the untainted mirth
of more than thrones in heaven

therefore  to thee this night
i will no requiem raise
but waft thee on thy flight
with a p an of old days


mysterious star
thou wert my dream
all a long summer night
be now my theme
by this clear stream
of thee will i write
meantime from afar
bathe me in light

thy world has not the dross of ours
yet all the beauty  all the flowers
that list our love or deck our bowers
in dreamy gardens  where do lie
dreamy maidens all the day
while the silver winds of circassy
on violet couches faint away
little  oh  little dwells in thee
like unto what on earth we see
beauty s eye is here the bluest
in the falsest and untruest
on the sweetest air doth float
the most sad and solemn note
if with thee be broken hearts
joy so peacefully departs
that its echo still doth dwell
like the murmur in the shell
thou  thy truest type of grief
is the gently falling leaf
thou  thy framing is so holy
sorrow is not melancholy

then rolled like tropic storms along
where  though the garish lights that fly
dying along the troubled sky
lay bare  through vistas thunder riven
the blackness of the general heaven
that very blackness yet doth fling
light on the lightning s silver wing

for being an idle boy lang syne
who read anacreon and drank wine
i early found anacreon rhymes
were almost passionate sometimes
and by strange alchemy of brain
his pleasures always turned to pain
his na vet  to wild desire
his wit to love  his wine to fire
and so  being young and dipt in folly
i fell in love with melancholy

and used to throw my earthly rest
and quiet all away in jest
i could not love except where death
was mingling his with beauty s breath
or hymen  time  and destiny
were stalking between her and me

gone are the glory and the gloom
the black hath mellow d into gray
and all the fires are fading away

my draught of passion hath been deep
i revell d  and i now would sleep
and after drunkenness of soul
succeeds the glories of the bowl
an idle longing night and day
to dream my very life away

aspiringly  are damned  and die
yet should i swear i mean alone
by notes so very shrilly blown
to break upon time s monotone
while yet my vapid joy and grief
are tintless of the yellow leaf
why not an imp the greybeard hath
will shake his shadow in my path
and e en the greybeard will o erlook
connivingly my dreaming book


from childhood s hour i have not been
as others were  i have not seen
as others saw  i could not bring
my passions from a common spring
from the same source i have not taken
my sorrow  i could not awaken
my heart to joy at the same tone
and all i loved   i  loved alone
of a most stormy life  was drawn
from every depth of good and ill
the mystery which binds me still
from the torrent  or the fountain
from the red cliff of the mountain
from the sun that round me roll d
in its autumn tint of gold
from the lightning in the sky
as it passed me flying by
from the thunder and the storm
and the cloud that took the form
of a demon in my view


beneath the vine clad eaves
whose shadows fall before
thy lowly cottage door
under the lilac s tremulous leaves
within thy snowy clasped hand
the purple flowers it bore
last eve in dreams  i saw thee stand
like queenly nymph from fairy land
enchantress of the flowery wand
most beauteous isadore

and when i bade the dream
upon thy spirit flee
thy violet eyes to me
upturned  did overflowing seem
with the deep  untold delight
of love s serenity
thy classic brow  like lilies white
and pale as the imperial night
upon her throne  with stars bedight
enthralled my soul to thee

ah  ever i behold
thy dreamy  passionate eyes
blue as the languid skies
hung with the sunset s fringe of gold
now strangely clear thine image grows
and olden memories
are startled from their long repose
like shadows on the silent snows
when suddenly the night wind blows
where quiet moonlight lies

like music heard in dreams
like strains of harps unknown
of birds for ever flown
audible as the voice of streams
that murmur in some leafy dell
i hear thy gentlest tone
and silence cometh with her spell
like that which on my tongue doth dwell
when tremulous in dreams i tell
my love to thee alone

v        in every valley heard
floating from tree to tree
less beautiful to me
the music of the radiant bird
than artless accents such as thine
whose echoes never flee
ah  how for thy sweet voice i pine
for uttered in thy tones benign
doth seem a melody


in these rapid  restless shadows
once i walked at eventide
when a gentle  silent maiden
walked in beauty at my side
she alone there walked beside me
all in beauty  like a bride

pallidly the moon was shining
on the dewy meadows nigh
on the silvery  silent rivers
on the mountains far and high
on the ocean s star lit waters
where the winds a weary die

slowly  silently we wandered
from the open cottage door
underneath the elm s long branches
to the pavement bending o er
underneath the mossy willow
and the dying sycamore

with the myriad stars in beauty
all bedight  the heavens were seen
radiant hopes were bright around me
like the light of stars serene
like the mellow midnight splendor
of the night s irradiate queen

audibly the elm leaves whispered
peaceful  pleasant melodies
like the distant murmured music
of unquiet  lovely seas
while the winds were hushed in slumber
in the fragrant flowers and trees

wondrous and unwonted beauty
still adorning all did seem
while i told my love in fables
would the heart have kept unspoken
love that was its rarest dream

instantly away we wandered
in the shadowy twilight tide
she  the silent  scornful maiden
walking calmly at my side
with a step serene and stately
all in beauty  all in pride

vacantly i walked beside her
on the earth mine eyes were cast
swift and keen there came unto me
bitter memories of the past
on me  like the rain in autumn
on the dead leaves  cold and fast

underneath the elms we parted
by the lowly cottage door
one brief word alone was uttered
never on our lips before
and away i walked forlornly
broken hearted evermore

slowly  silently i loitered
homeward  in the night  alone
sudden anguish bound my spirit
that my youth had never known
wild unrest  like that which cometh
when the night s first dream hath flown

now  to me the elm leaves whisper
mad  discordant melodies
and keen melodies like shadows
haunt the moaning willow trees
and the sycamores with laughter
mock me in the nightly breeze

sad and pale the autumn moonlight
through the sighing foliage streams
and each morning  midnight shadow
shadow of my sorrow seems
strive  o heart  forget thine idol
and  o soul  forget thy dreams


the hands of men
tamed this primeval wood
and hoary trees with groans of wo
like warriors by an unknown foe
were in their strength subdued
the virgin earth
gave instant birth
to springs that ne er did flow
that in the sun
did rivulets run
and all around rare flowers did blow
the wild rose pale
perfumed the gale
and the queenly lily adown the dale
and the winds did woo
with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew

so when in tears
the love of years
is wasted like the snow
and the fine fibrils of its life
by the rude wrong of instant strife
are broken at a blow
within the heart
do springs upstart
of which it doth now know
and strange  sweet dreams
like silent streams
that from new fountains overflow
with the earlier tide
of rivers glide
deep in the heart whose hope has died
quenching the fires its ashes hide
its ashes  whence will spring and grow
sweet flowers  ere long
the rare and radiant flowers of song

i arise from dreams of thee
in the first sweet sleep of night
when the winds are breathing low
and the stars are shining bright
i arise from dreams of thee
and a spirit in my feet
has led me  who knows how
to thy chamber window  sweet

the wandering airs they faint
on the dark the silent stream
the champak odors fail
like sweet thoughts in a dream
the nightingale s complaint
it dies upon her heart
as i must die on thine
o  beloved as thou art

o  lift me from the grass
i die  i faint  i fail
let thy love in kisses rain
on my lips and eyelids pale
my cheek is cold and white  alas
my heart beats loud and fast
o  press it close to thine again
where it will break at last

the shadows lay along broadway
and slowly there a lady fair
was walking in her pride
alone walk d she  but  viewlessly
walk d spirits at her side

peace charm d the street beneath her feet
and honor charm d the air
and all astir looked kind on her
and called her good as fair
for all god ever gave to her
she kept with chary care

she kept with care her beauties rare
from lovers warm and true
for heart was cold to all but gold
and the rich came not to woo
but honor d well her charms to sell
if priests the selling do

now walking there was one more fair
a slight girl  lily pale
and she had unseen company
to make the spirit quail
twixt want and scorn she walk d forlorn
and nothing could avail

no mercy now can clear her brow
from this world s peace to pray
for as love s wild prayer dissolved in air
her woman s heart gave way
but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven
by man is cursed alway

the day is done  and the darkness
falls from the wings of night
as a feather is wafted downward
from an eagle in his flight

i see the lights of the village
gleam through the rain and the mist
and a feeling of sadness comes o er me
that my soul cannot resist

a feeling of sadness and longing
that is not akin to pain
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain

come  read to me some poem
some simple and heartfelt lay
that shall soothe this restless feeling
and banish the thoughts of day

not from the grand old masters
not from the bards sublime
whose distant footsteps echo
through the corridors of time

for  like strains of martial music
their mighty thoughts suggest
life s endless toil and endeavor
and to night i long for rest

read from some humbler poet
whose songs gushed from his heart
as showers from the clouds of summer
or tears from the eyelids start

who through long days of labor
and nights devoid of ease
still heard in his soul the music
of wonderful melodies

such songs have power to quiet
the restless pulse of care
and come like the benediction
that follows after prayer

then read from the treasured volume
the poem of thy choice
and lend to the rhyme of the poet
the beauty of thy voice

and the night shall be filled with music
and the cares that infest the day
shall fold their tents like the arabs
and as silently steal away

whose distant footsteps echo
down the corridors of time

there  through the long  long summer hours
the golden light should lie
and thick young herbs and groups of flowers
stand in their beauty by
the oriole should build and tell
his love tale  close beside my cell
the idle butterfly
should rest him there  and there be heard
the housewife bee and humming bird

and what  if cheerful shouts at noon
come  from the village sent
or songs of maids  beneath the moon
with fairy laughter blent
and what if  in the evening light
betrothed lovers walk in sight
of my low monument
i would the lovely scene around
might know no sadder sight nor sound

i know  i know i should not see
the season s glorious show
nor would its brightness shine for me
nor its wild music flow

but if  around my place of sleep
the friends i love should come to weep
they might not haste to go
soft airs and song  and light and bloom
should keep them lingering by my tomb

these to their soften d hearts should bear
the thought of what has been
and speak of one who cannot share
the gladness of the scene
whose part in all the pomp that fills
the circuit of the summer hills
is  that his grave is green
and deeply would their hearts rejoice
to hear again his living voice

a feeling of sadness and longing
that is not akin to pain
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain

i fill this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone
a woman  of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon
to whom the better elements
and kindly stars have given
a form so fair  that like the air

her every tone is music s own
like those of morning birds
and something more than melody
dwells ever in her words
the coinage of her heart are they
and from her lips each flows
as one may see the burden d bee
forth issue from the rose

affections are as thoughts to her
the measures of her hours
her feelings have the fragrancy
the freshness of young flowers
and lovely passions  changing oft
so fill her  she appears
the image of themselves by turns
the idol of past years

of her bright face one glance will trace
a picture on the brain
and of her voice in echoing hearts
a sound must long remain
but memory  such as mine of her
so very much endears
when death is nigh my latest sigh
will not be life s  but hers

i fill d this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone
a woman  of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon
her health  and would on earth there stood
some more of such a frame
that life might be all poetry
and weariness a name

come  rest in this bosom  my own stricken deer
though the herd have fled from thee  thy home is still here
here still is the smile  that no cloud can o ercast
and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last

oh  what was love made for  if  tis not the same
through joy and through torment  through glory and shame
i know not  i ask not  if guilt s in that heart
i but know that i love thee  whatever thou art

thou hast call d me thy angel in moments of bliss
and thy angel i ll be  mid the horrors of this
through the furnace  unshrinking  thy steps to pursue
and shield thee  and save thee   or perish there too

o saw ye not fair ines
she s gone into the west
to dazzle when the sun is down
and rob the world of rest
she took our daylight with her
the smiles that we love best
with morning blushes on her cheek
and pearls upon her breast

o turn again  fair ines
before the fall of night
for fear the moon should shine alone
and stars unrivall d bright
and blessed will the lover be
that walks beneath their light
and breathes the love against thy cheek
i dare not even write

would i had been  fair ines
that gallant cavalier
who rode so gaily by thy side
and whisper d thee so near
were there no bonny dames at home
or no true lovers here
that he should cross the seas to win
the dearest of the dear

i saw thee  lovely ines
descend along the shore
with bands of noble gentlemen
and banners waved before
and gentle youth and maidens gay
and snowy plumes they wore
it would have been a beauteous dream
if it had been no more

alas  alas  fair ines
she went away with song
with music waiting on her steps
and shoutings of the throng
but some were sad and felt no mirth
but only music s wrong
in sounds that sang farewell  farewell
to her you ve loved so long

farewell  farewell  fair ines
that vessel never bore
so fair a lady on its deck
nor danced so light before
alas for pleasure on the sea
and sorrow on the shore
the smile that blest one lover s heart
has broken many more

one more unfortunate
weary of breath
rashly importunate
gone to her death

take her up tenderly
lift her with care
fashion d so slenderly
young and so fair

look at her garments
clinging like cerements
whilst the wave constantly
drips from her clothing
take her up instantly
loving  not loathing

touch her not scornfully
think of her mournfully
gently and humanly
not of the stains of her
all that remains of her
now is pure womanly

make no deep scrutiny
into her mutiny
rash and undutiful
past all dishonor
death has left on her
only the beautiful

where the lamps quiver
so far in the river
with many a light
from window and casement
from garret to basement
she stood  with amazement
houseless by night

the bleak wind of march
made her tremble and shiver
but not the dark arch
or the black flowing river
mad from life s history
glad to death s mystery
swift to be hurl d
anywhere  anywhere
out of the world

in she plunged boldly
no matter how coldly
the rough river ran
over the brink of it
picture it   think of it
dissolute man
lave in it  drink of it
then  if you can

still  for all slips of hers
one of eve s family
wipe those poor lips of hers
oozing so clammily
loop up her tresses
escaped from the comb
her fair auburn tresses
whilst wonderment guesses
where was her home

who was her father
who was her mother
had she a sister
had she a brother
or was there a dearer one
still  and a nearer one
yet  than all other

alas  for the rarity
of christian charity
under the sun
oh  it was pitiful
near a whole city full
home she had none

sisterly  brotherly
fatherly  motherly
feelings had changed
love  by harsh evidence
thrown from its eminence
even god s providence
seeming estranged

take her up tenderly
lift her with care
fashion d so slenderly
young  and so fair
ere her limbs frigidly
stiffen too rigidly
decently   kindly
smooth and compose them
and her eyes  close them
staring so blindly

dreadfully staring
through muddy impurity
as when with the daring
last look of despairing
fixed on futurity

perishing gloomily
spurred by contumely
cold inhumanity
burning insanity
into her rest
cross her hands humbly
as if praying dumbly
over her breast
owning her weakness
her evil behavior
and leaving  with meekness
her sins to her saviour

and the star of my fate hath declined
thy soft heart refused to discover
the faults which so many could find
though thy soul with my grief was acquainted
it shrunk not to share it with me
and the love which my spirit hath painted
it never hath found but in  thee

then when nature around me is smiling
the last smile which answers to mine
i do not believe it beguiling
because it reminds me of thine
and when winds are at war with the ocean
as the breasts i believed in with me
if their billows excite an emotion
it is that they bear me from  thee

though the rock of my last hope is shivered
and its fragments are sunk in the wave
though i feel that my soul is delivered
to pain  it shall not be its slave
there is many a pang to pursue me
they may crush  but they shall not contemn
they may torture  but shall not subdue me

though human  thou didst not deceive me
though woman  thou didst not forsake
though loved  thou forborest to grieve me
though slandered  thou never couldst shake
though trusted  thou didst not disclaim me
though parted  it was not to fly
though watchful   twas not to defame me
nor mute  that the world might belie

yet i blame not the world  nor despise it
nor the war of the many with one
if my soul was not fitted to prize it
and if dearly that error hath cost me
and more than i once could foresee
i have found that whatever it lost me
it could not deprive me of  thee

from the wreck of the past  which hath perished
thus much i at least may recall
it hath taught me that which i most cherished
deserved to be dearest of all
in the desert a fountain is springing
in the wide waste there still is a tree
and a bird in the solitude singing
which speaks to my spirit of  thee

tears  idle tears  i know not what they mean
tears from the depth of some divine despair
rise in the heart  and gather to the eyes
in looking on the happy autumn fields
and thinking of the days that are no more

fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail
that brings our friends up from the underworld
sad as the last which reddens over one
that sinks with all we love below the verge
so sad  so fresh  the days that are no more

ah  sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
the earliest pipe of half awaken d birds
to dying ears  when unto dying eyes
the casement slowly grows a glimmering square
so sad  so strange  the days that are no more

dear as remember d kisses after death
and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign d
on lips that are for others  deep as love
deep as first love  and wild with all regret
o death in life  the days that are no more

a sword of metal keene
al else to noble heartes is drosse
al else on earth is meane
the neighynge of the war horse prowde
the rowleing of the drum
the clangor of the trumpet lowde
be soundes from heaven that come
and oh  the thundering presse of knightes
when as their war cryes welle
may tole from heaven an angel bright
and rowse a fiend from hell

then mounte  then mounte  brave gallants all
and don your helmes amaine
deathe s couriers  fame and honor  call
us to the field againe
no shrewish teares shall fill your eye
when the sword hilt s in our hand
heart whole we ll part  and no whit sighe
for the fayrest of the land
let piping swaine  and craven wight
thus weepe and puling crye
our business is like men to fight
and hero like to die

or the least boughs rustleling
by a daisy whose leaves spread
shut when titan goes to bed
or a shady bush or tree
she could more infuse in me
than all nature s beauties con
in some other wiser man
by her help i also now
make this churlish place allow
something that may sweeten gladness
in the very gall of sadness
the dull loneness  the black shade
that these hanging vaults have made
the strange music of the waves
beating on these hollow caves
this black den which rocks emboss
overgrown with eldest moss
the rude portals that give light
more to terror than delight
this my chamber of neglect
walled about with disrespect
from all these and this dull air
a fit object for despair
she hath taught me by her might
to draw comfort and delight

it is a wondrous thing how fleet
with what a pretty skipping grace
it oft would challenge me the race
and when t had left me far away
for it was nimbler much than hinds
and trod as if on the four winds
i have a garden of my own
but so with roses overgrown
and lilies  that you would it guess
to be a little wilderness
and all the spring time of the year
it only loved to be there
have sought it oft where it should lie
yet could not  till itself would rise
find it  although before mine eyes
for in the flaxen lilies shade
it like a bank of lilies laid
upon the roses it would feed
until its lips even seemed to bleed
and then to me  twould boldly trip
and print those roses on my lip
but all its chief delight was still
with roses thus itself to fill
and its pure virgin limbs to fold
in whitest sheets of lilies cold
had it lived long  it would have been
lilies without  roses within
